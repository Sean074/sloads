"""Widget identity across a project replacement — the *project generation*.

Streamlit widget state, once registered under a key, wins over the ``value=``
argument on every later rerun. Widget keys are stable across projects — a
registry path in :mod:`oracle_app.form` — so a page **visited before** a load
kept re-rendering its own retained state, and, because those widgets persist
what they return, wrote that stale state straight back over the project that
had just been loaded. This GUI has no Apply step, so it happened on the load's
own rerun: the row-count widget of a table held ``0``, so all 21
``weight.items`` and all 8 ``cg_cases`` of a loaded ATR-42 were popped, and
saving from there put the emptied project on disk. It is not a display defect and re-seeding does not fix
it: the widget has to be a **different widget**.

This module is that difference. Every widget seeded from the project keys itself
through :func:`widget_key`, which stamps the key with a counter bumped exactly
once per *replacement* of the session's project — by
:func:`app_shell.project_state.adopt` (a load), and by the JSON editor's Apply
(:mod:`app_shell.project_editor`), which replaces the project without saving it
and so bumps here without touching the dirty baseline. A mutation, a per-page
Apply, a unit switch: not a replacement, and the widgets keep their state.

The alternative — clearing widget state on adopt — needs a list of keys the
shell would have to keep in step with the field registry and every page that
renders one; it is wrong the first time a widget is added, and silent about it.
The generation stamp is carried by the key itself, so a new widget is fresh by
construction, and ``tests/test_widget_freshness.py`` fails on one that skips it.

It lives in its own module, not in ``project_state``, so the shell's unit
boundary (:func:`app_shell.components.unit_number_input`) can stamp keys without
importing the module that imports *it*.
