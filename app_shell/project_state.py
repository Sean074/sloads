"""The project in session state, and the unsaved-changes guard around replacing it.

The whole app is one reloadable ``project.json`` carried in
``st.session_state["project"]``. This module owns that slot: seeding it, keeping
the *saved snapshot* baseline the dirty flag diffs against, and the
load-guard chain every load action goes through —

    safe_load(read_dict, source)  ->  load_with_guard
                                          |
                    clean project ---> adopt + rerun
                    dirty project ---> confirm_discard dialog

Extracted from ``app/Home.py`` by design note 32 step OG-B. They were private
module functions of a Streamlit *script*: importing them meant executing the
existing app (``st.set_page_config``, the sidebar, ``pg.run()``), so the second
GUI could not reuse them and would have had to carry its own copy of the dirty
guard — two implementations of "are there unsaved changes?", which is the class
of duplication ``CLAUDE.md`` rule 3 exists to prevent. Behaviour is unchanged
from the script version; only the leading underscores are gone, since these are
now the shell's public surface.

The shell does **no** schema classification of its own (#93): a file at any
version but the current one is refused by the gate in ``sloads.migrations``, and
``safe_load``'s existing error handling reports the refusal like any other bad
file. Guard: ``tests/test_app_shell.py::test_no_gui_decides_whether_a_file_is_readable``.
