"""Shared Streamlit UI components reused across every sloads GUI.

Thin presentation wrappers over the pure-calc package; they hold no load math of
their own. The FAR 23 applicability banner is the shared component here: the
detection lives in :func:`sloads.far23_applicability` (pure, unit-tested) and
this module only renders it and wires the "switch to Concept" action.

The fleet comparison used to live here too, shared by two input pages; it now has
its own dedicated home in ``app/views/aircraft_comparison.py`` (backlog F2).

Moved out of ``app/`` into :mod:`app_shell` by design note 32 step OG-B. The one
front-end assumption that survived that move -- :func:`workflow_page_link`
emitting ``views/<key>.py``, which is true of ``app/`` and of no GUI that builds
its pages any other way -- was removed by OG-F: the target is now the running
GUI's own page object, resolved through :mod:`app_shell.nav`. Neither the page
set nor its shape is shared; each GUI derives its own (note 32, OG-2).

    ``value=None`` renders the widget **empty** and returns ``None`` until the

      one step up: see :mod:`app_shell.widget_keys`.)

    A page whose result reads a slice entered further down the workflow shows a
    complete-looking answer that changes once that later page is filled -- the
    Flap page's 23.457(b) slipstream case is a whole *delivered case* that does
    not exist until an engine record does, ~19 % of the governing flap load on
    the C210. Downloaded in between, the numbers are wrong and nothing on the
    page ever said why.

    The dependencies are declared on the step (:attr:`sloads.workflow.WorkflowStep.reads`)
    and resolved by :func:`sloads.workflow.later_page_reads`, so this renders
    what the workflow already knows and holds no list of its own. Stated on
    every visit, not only when the slice is absent: it is provenance either way,
    and a mark that appears only in the broken state teaches nothing about the
    page. The loud channel stays :func:`render_consistency_warnings` -- this one
    is a caption, and turns into a warning only when a dependency is genuinely
    still empty.

    Links to the entering page when the running GUI carries it; the oracle GUI
    has fourteen of the twenty-two steps, so the name degrades to plain text
    rather than pointing at a page that is not there.
