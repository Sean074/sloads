"""Command-line runner for the sloads suite.

Run one module against a project file and emit its load-case CSV (or a text
report to stdout):

    python cli.py engine examples/ga6_normal.project.json -o engine_loads.csv
    python cli.py engine examples/ga6_normal.project.json        # text to stdout
    python cli.py --list                                         # registered modules

Or export loads to sbeam (CSV + FORCE/MOMENT cards). ``--export-target`` is the
whole deliverable menu -- every artifact the Export & Report page writes is
reachable headless, because the concept-loads -> sbeam sizing loop is meant to be
scripted:

===============  ===========================================================
target           what it writes
===============  ===========================================================
``wing``         the net wing load: span-load CSV + FORCE/MOMENT cards
                 (+ an optional CBAR stick model), transferred to the wing's
                 loads reference axis
``body``         the fuselage net distribution: FORCE deck, span-load CSV and
                 the wing-attach fitting-load CSV
``tail``         the chordwise tail loads (TAILDIST)
``htail-span``   the **spanwise** empennage beam loads (plan 09 T4)
``vtail-span``
``control``      the simplified control-surface loads (AILERON/FLAPLOAD/
                 TABLOADS)
``balanced``     the assembled full-span balanced free-free deck -- the
                 mission's primary loads deliverable
``gear``         the landing gear interface load definition (decision G-12) --
                 per case and per leg, the reaction at the tyre contact patch
                 with its strut state and ground angle, and the same reaction
                 at the gear reference point
``mass``         the CONM2/MASSSET mass model (same artifacts, same owner and
                 same names as ``--export-conm2``)
``lra``          the LRA beam model (step 12) -- node lines on the load
                 reference axes, CBAR chains, rigid posts/attachments/gear/
                 engine ties, the balanced cases' load sets transferred onto
                 the nodes. With ``--lra-import MODEL.bdf`` the loads are
                 instead transferred onto the imported model's own nodes,
                 under its GIDs (the named-node contract maps the families)
===============  ===========================================================

    python cli.py --export-sbeam out examples/ga6_normal.project.json
    python cli.py --export-sbeam out --export-target body examples/ga6_normal.project.json
    python cli.py --export-sbeam out --export-target balanced examples/ga6_normal.project.json
    python cli.py --export-conm2 out examples/ga6_normal.project.json

Or render the consolidated **summary report** (Step G8) -- the controlling
document of a loads deliverable. The ``.tex`` is always written; ask for a
``.pdf`` path and it is compiled too, when a TeX engine is on ``PATH``:

    python cli.py --report out.tex examples/ga6_normal.project.json
    python cli.py --report out.pdf examples/ga6_normal.project.json --units si

Output units follow ``--units imperial|si`` (default: the project's own
preference, else Imperial). An sbeam deck is written in the **solver** unit set,
which in SI is N / mm / N*mm / MPa -- consistent by construction, unlike the
N*m a report uses (M4-20 D-19).

**Every file written here carries the Step G8.3 methods & limitations stamp**
(``#`` on a CSV, ``$`` on a deck), exactly as the GUI bundle does: a headless
export states its ULTIMATE basis, its category and its approved corrections
in-band, so a file forwarded on its own is still self-describing (L-8g).

**Error contract** (one, for every export route): an absent input slice or an
invalid input is reported as ``error: <message>`` on stderr with exit status 1 --
never a traceback, and never a silently empty artifact. The one deliberate
exception is the ``control`` target, where an *absent* control-surface slice
(``MissingInputError``) skips that surface, because the three surfaces are
independent; an *invalid* one still fails the run, and a target where every
surface is absent fails too.
