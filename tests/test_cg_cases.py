"""The one weight/CG case list and the two design weights (step 10 piece 2).

CLAUDE.md practice 3: a cross-cutting convention gets a single-source code owner
**plus a drift-guard test**. :mod:`sloads.cg_cases` is the owner; this is the
guard, and it pins the four claims the piece is made of:

1. **Every case says what it is for.** A case tagged for no analysis is an entry
   error, not a state (G-3c). Decision G-3b's neutrality guard -- the
   ``FLIGHT``-tagged set equals the pre-hop ``flight_loads.cg_cases``, per
   fixture -- lived here until #93 retired the v46 hop with the rest of the
   chain. It was re-proven at the cut against the pre-regeneration files (all six
   fixtures, flight and ground sets identical) and then removed with the hop it
   guarded; the examples are now post-hop, so the pre-hop list it read no longer
   exists to compare against.
2. **The role is the ordering contract, not the name.** LANDLOAD indexes its three
   loadings positionally and is oracle-locked to Appendix A p230; before G-3a the
   order was recovered by *matching names*, falling back to entry order with only
   a warning, so renaming a row silently reordered the reaction table.
3. **Both design weights have one owner.** In particular the removed
   ``landing.gross_weight_lb`` fell back to ``max(landing cg_cases)``, which is
   MLW rather than MTOW -- ``WR = 1.0``, understating cases 13-24 by ~5 %.
4. **G-5 burn-down reaches a landing weight by burning fuel, not by dropping a
   passenger**, and it cannot touch a flight case, which is what keeps the
   Appendix-A oracles still.
