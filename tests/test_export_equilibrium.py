"""Export-boundary closure gate: every deck, every example, both unit systems.

Concept mode has no printed oracle, so a *stated physics-closure gate in CI* is
what stands in for one (``CLAUDE.md`` required practice 2). Four such checks
already existed, but all four were force-only, Imperial-only, and hand-rolled
four separate times. This module is the gate in its intended form -- one
parameterised sweep over

    every shipped example  x  {Imperial, SI}  x  {wing, body, tail, control}

asserting that each deck's Σ``FORCE`` **and** Σ``MOMENT``, re-derived from the
deck's own card text via :mod:`sloads.export.equilibrium`, equal that
component's own stated resultant. What it adds over what existed:

* **moment closure at all** -- nothing verified a moment from any deck's text.
  In particular the body deck's ``$`` header has claimed "Terminal Myy ...
  (moment equilibrium)" since step C6 with nothing checking it;
* **SI** -- ``system=`` was never varied, so a unit set with
  ``moment.factor != force.factor x length.factor`` (the exact D-19 failure mode)
  passed the whole suite, force-only sums being blind to it;
* **the ga6 oracle fixture's body / tail / control decks**, previously covered on
  the concept fixture only.

Reference points are the per-component convention (``CONVENTIONS.md``; design
note ``docs/40_history/15_export_equilibrium_invariant_plan.md`` §3, E-2): wing ->
its root station, body -> its aft-most station, tail -> its leading-edge chord
station. Tolerances are :mod:`sloads.export.equilibrium`'s, not this file's.

Physics basis: Ref 1 Ch 14 (net wing loads), Ch 15 p103 (the free-free fuselage
beam), Ch 10 (chordwise tail distribution).

    beside it cannot disagree about it, which is the failure mode the boundary
    owns (a card routed to the wrong GID, a truncated coordinate, a GID block
    shared between two components with different chords).

    All six components are checked, the zeros included, because the axis itself is
    what this deck got wrong (review F-C3): the fin's normal force is a **side**
    force, so its cards are ``Fy`` and its chordwise moment is ``Mz``. Summing
    ``v[2]`` for both components -- what this test did until D-R4 -- is exactly the
    assertion that enshrined the defect.
