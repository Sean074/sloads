"""The headless deliverable — 0.5.0 row 1 (review F-D1 / F-C2 / F-D3, m2, L-8g).

The mission is a **scripted** concept-loads → sbeam sizing loop, so "the GUI can
write it" is not the same as "the deliverable exists". Three gaps closed here,
each with its own gate:

* **F-D1 — reachability.** ``--export-target`` is the whole deliverable menu:
  wing, body, tail, the two spanwise empennage surfaces, control surfaces, the
  assembled **balanced free-free deck** (the mission's primary artifact, which
  was writable only from a Streamlit page) and the CONM2 **mass model**.
  :func:`test_the_export_menu_is_the_deliverable_menu` pins the menu against
  ``cli.EXPORT_TARGETS`` and against argparse, so a target cannot be implemented
  without being offered or offered without being implemented.
* **F-C2 / decision D-R5 — the wing axis.** The CLI passed a bare result list to
  the writers, so the boundary transfer to the surface's loads reference axis
  never ran and the headless deck's torsion, station X and lever arms were about
  the 25 % chord while the GUI's were about the LRA. The two front-ends are now
  the same deck, and the axis is pinned on a project whose LRA is *not* the
  quarter chord — on a shipped fixture (``ref_axis_pct`` 0.25 everywhere) the
  transfer is a no-op and would pin nothing.
* **F-D3 / L-8g — the stamp.** Every headless CSV and BDF carries the Step G8.3
  methods & limitations block, so a file forwarded on its own still states its
  ULTIMATE basis, its category and its approved corrections.

Plus **m2**, the error contract: one contract for every route — ``error: …`` on
stderr and status 1, never a traceback, and never a swallowed invalid input.

Conventions: ``docs/10_standard/CONVENTIONS.md``. Error-handling contract:
``docs/10_standard/00_program_overview.md``.
