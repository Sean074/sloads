"""Pytest setup: make the repo root importable so ``import sloads`` works and
``tests/`` importable so the test modules can reach the shared
:mod:`helpers` / :mod:`fixtures` support modules.

**A test module never imports another test module** (M4-12a). Shared lookup
helpers live in ``tests/helpers.py`` and shared input builders in
``tests/fixtures.py``; neither collects as a test.

The repo root also resolves ``import app_shell`` for the view smoke test, which
runs each ``app/views/*.py`` as its own entrypoint. ``app/`` itself is *not* on
the path: since design note 32 step OG-B the shared shell is a real package
(``app_shell/``) rather than bare top-level modules on Streamlit's implicit
entrypoint path, so a view resolves it the same way anything else does.

    repository installed. Local development without it stays frictionless: those
    tests skip. But a bare ``importorskip`` would let a **broken CI install**
    report green, which is the exact failure mode the gate exists to end -- so
    the round-trip CI job sets ``SLOADS_REQUIRE_SBEAM=1`` and the skip becomes a
    failure there.
