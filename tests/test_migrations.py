"""The schema gate (#93), and the migration machinery kept behind it.

Pre-production a project file is read at the current ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` or a
version the hop chain reaches it from — v55, through the additive-identity
55→56 hop (note 36 OV-10, #97), the semantic 56→57 landing-N hop (note 37
LF-8, #123) and the two additive-identity ``LoadValue`` hops that follow it
(57→58 ``frame``, note 38 GF-6/#134; 58→59 ``point``, #141) — and
`sloads.migrations.migrate`
raises `SchemaVersionError` for anything else: older than the floor, newer, or
unversioned. This file pins that gate, and pins that the hop chain works
(`migrations.py` module docstring).

Until #93 this file tested twelve hops against eleven frozen legacy fixtures
(M4-10). Those hops and fixtures went out together; what remains of that
discipline is `tests/fixtures_schema/v55_current.json`, one frozen file at the
version this build reads, and the examples-are-current guard in
`test_schema_guards.py`.
