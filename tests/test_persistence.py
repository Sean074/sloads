"""Persistence verification (Step M2-7 / decision G-3).

Two guarantees:

1. **Save->reload is a no-op for every shipped example** -- the project JSON is the
   single reloadable store; loading and re-serializing changes nothing.
2. **Field coverage: every input-dataclass field survives an ``io`` round-trip** --
   a *completeness guard*. For each input slice we build an instance with every field
   set to a distinct non-default sentinel (recursively, through nested dataclasses /
   lists / enums), round-trip it through its ``io`` ``*_from_dict``/``*_to_dict`` pair,
   and assert every field comes back unchanged. This fails the build when a field is
   added to an input dataclass but not wired into ``io`` -- the classic silent
   persistence bug. Fields that are *intentionally* derived rather than stored (the
   Step M2-6 single-source cleanup, the Step G6/G6b geometry moves) are listed in
   ``DERIVED_NOT_PERSISTED`` and skipped.
