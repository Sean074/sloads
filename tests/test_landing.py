"""Landing / ground loads (Step C10): LGFACTOR.BAS + LANDLOAD.BAS port.

Two oracle bands (Reference 1 Ch 20):

* **LGFACTOR is fully oracle-locked** against Appendix A "Landing Load Factor"
  p236: descent velocity ``V = 4.4*(W/S)^0.25`` (9.0048 fps), airplane load factor
  ``N`` (3.0951) and gear factor ``NLG = N - L`` (2.4281). N is within +0.07% of the
  printed value -- the expected Decision-3 drift from ``G = 32.174`` vs the program's
  ``32.2`` (still inside +-0.1%).

* **LANDLOAD is fully oracle-locked** against Appendix A: p230 "Landing Loads with
  Respect to Ground Line" for the intermediates -- the drag factor ``K`` (0.324),
  ``GAMMA = arctan(K)`` (17.978), the ground angles (4.057 / 4.724 / 15 deg), ``BETA``
  (13.921 / 4.724 / 15) and the ``AP/BP/DP/CP`` lever-arm table -- and then **every
  printed cell** of p231 (ground line), p232 (airplane datum) and p233 (limit
  unbalanced moments), for all 33 cases.

  Those three pages are OCR-garbled in the bundled PDF and were recorded from
  2026-08-15 as unusable, so the 24-main / 33-nose matrix was held by formula
  closure plus a handful of legible cells -- the ONENGOUT (Step C9) precedent.
  **They are garbled, not illegible**: rendered at 200 dpi they read cleanly, and
  the tables were transcribed on 2026-08-29. Reading them found two defects that
  had lived in the gap (#135, #137), one of which had made a fixture input a
  function of the output it was used to check. Transcription and OCR extraction
  are not the same failure mode, which is why the citations now say which one a
  cell came from.

Note the manual's LANDLOAD runs at a **rounded design load factor** distinct from
LGFACTOR's computed 2.428: since note 37 that is entered as the governing
**airplane** load factor ``N = 3.167`` (the oracle's ``NAP = NLG + L`` =
2.5 + 0.667) and ``NLG = N - L = 2.5`` is derived -- never entered -- so the
wing lift factor L always moves the gear reaction (gate G-LF-2).

# bundled PDF's *text layer* for these pages is garbled, and from 2026-08-15
# the project recorded them as unusable and held cases 13-33 on internal
# identities alone. Two defects lived in that gap -- the ``WL(18)`` gross-weight
# ratio (#135) and a fixture weight that had been back-solved from a
# mis-OCR'd cell (#137), which also meant an input was derived from the output
# it was then used to check. The pages read cleanly rendered.
#
# The printed resolution is the tolerance: integer columns lock at +-0.5 or

# executable rather than prose. If a deviation is approved, the affected rows
# move to the corrected values with the register entry cited beside them --
