"""The engine hub thrust ``FORCE`` -- gates G-1 … G-11 (backlog #10).

Carved out of design note ``docs/30_future/21_power_effects_wing_note.md``,
whose seven-step wake plan stays parked. What ships is one user-entered
``EngineInput.thrust_lb`` per engine, applied as an axial force at that
engine's hub, and this file is its benchmark-first gate. There is no printed
oracle for a number the user types, so every gate here is a **closed form or an
invariant** -- the standard `CLAUDE.md` rule 2 sets for concept-mode physics:

* **G-1** the feature is off by default and changes nothing: no shipped fixture
  enters thrust, ``None`` and ``0.0`` both apply nothing, and the assembled set
  is identical load for load to the one built before this step;
* **G-2** what is applied is exactly what was entered: one force per engine at
  its own ``prop_cg``, ``fx = -T`` (``CONVENTIONS.md`` §1, ``x`` +aft), summing
  to the entered total;
* **G-3** the residual **is** the thrust: the pre-closure ``Fx`` moves by
  exactly ``-sum T`` and the pre-closure ``My`` by exactly
  ``sum -T*(z_hub - z_cg)``, both in closed form -- the reason
  :data:`~sloads.modules.balance.RESIDUAL_GATE` is exempted for a powered case
  rather than merely relaxed;
* **G-4** ``n_x = (D - sum T)/W``: a constructed case whose thrust equals its
  own drag closes at ``n_x = 0`` -- design note 21 §4.3's stated gate;
* **G-5** six-DOF closure still holds with thrust in the set, in memory and from
  the balanced deck's own card text;
* **G-6** the thrust lands on the LRA **hub node**, with a transfer couple of
  exactly zero, and the transferred set keeps the case's resultant (the plan-07
  gate, with thrust present);
* **G-7** thrust with nowhere to act **raises**, naming the datum, rather than
  being placed on a guess;
* **G-8** ground cases carry no thrust and say so in-band;
* **G-9** the hub falls back to ``engine_cg`` only when no ``prop_cg`` is
  entered;
* **G-10** the port twin of a handed powered case carries the mirrored thrust;
* **G-11** an **asymmetric** installation yaws the airplane and says so, mints
  no twin of its own (``is_handed`` measures lateral force and roll, and an
  axial force off the centreline makes neither), and states that a twin got
  from another source mirrors the installation with everything else.
