"""The one field registry is total, sourced and single-owner (note 32, OG-C).

`sloads/field_registry.py` answers three questions that were three separate
discussions before OG-14 merged them: **where is this field edited**, **did the
original suite ask for it**, and **is this quantity stored twice**. A table only
settles those if it cannot quietly fall out of step with the schema, so:

* **G4 — totality, both directions.** Every input field on ``Project`` has a
  row, and no row names a field the schema no longer has. Adding a field to
  ``models/inputs.py`` fails here until it is classified, which is the point:
  ``origin`` is a decision and a new field must not inherit one silently.
* **G5's precondition.** Every ``ORIGINAL`` field is editable from a page in the
  oracle set, so "populate only the original fields" is actually reachable in
  the second GUI. This is what caught ``aero_coeffs`` having no oracle page and
  produced OG-2's amendment (:func:`sloads.workflow.oracle_steps`). G5 itself
  lives in ``tests/test_oracle_inputs.py``; what stays here is the shape of the
  ``supplied`` column it needed — a `SLOADS` field the oracle input set cannot
  do without — because a mark that can be handed out freely would let any G5 failure be
  silenced by marking the offending field.
* **The duplicate-owner class** (the 2026-08-16 GUI review's N1, five instances;
  a sixth — the two ``shoulder_altitude_ft`` fields — fell out of writing the
  table). One owner per quantity, and every copy names the owner it syncs from.

Every row also carries a non-empty ``basis``. An origin claim with no citation
is the thing this project does not accept in the calc layer, and a registry of
uncited classifications would be a prose rule wearing a test's clothes.
