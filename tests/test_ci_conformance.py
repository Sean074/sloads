"""A documented git/CI setting cannot differ from the live one in silence.

**The defect class (2026-08-25, backlog row 6 / issue #46, review CR-D-4).** Two
instances in one day, the same shape both times: a doc stated one thing, the
live setting another, and nothing compared them.

* `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §4, `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0 (two rows) and
  `WORKFLOW_COMMANDS.txt` all said "linear history off, merge commits allowed".
  `main` enforces linear history; it refused the 0.7.2 milestone PR with "This
  branch must not contain merge commits" — at the cut, which is the worst moment
  to find it. Worse, the documented hotfix recovery told you to `git merge main`
  onto the milestone branch: the exact act that makes the milestone PR
  unmergeable, invisible until the cut.
* `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §2 listed six required checks — `test (3.9)`,
  `test (3.11)`, `sbeam-roundtrip (3.11)` among them — three of which `ci.yml`
  never produces on a pull request at all. A required check that never reports
  blocks its PR forever; the live setting was (correctly) the fast-gate three,
  and §2 contradicted its own §0 table on the same page.

**Why the comparison is two hops.** CI has no `gh` credential, so a test cannot
read GitHub. Hop 1 is here and always runs: `.github/branch-protection.json` (a
checked-in snapshot of the live settings) is asserted against the prose, and
against what `ci.yml` actually reports on a pull request. Hop 2 is
`scripts/branch_protection_snapshot.py --check`, which the owner runs — it needs
auth, and a gate that needs a credential CI lacks is a gate that silently skips,
which is the failure mode this file exists to end.
