"""The mass SSOT (step B1): ``weight.items`` -> per-component station inertia.

Plan 11 decision **B-2**. Before this step the suite carried two mass models —
the itemized ``weight.items`` database and a short hand-entered
``fuselage_mass.stations`` lump table — and **nothing compared them**. The
entered table was short of the item model by 10 % to 100 % of the beam on every
shipped fixture, so every fuselage inertia load, shear, bending moment and
exported body card was computed from a beam carrying less mass than the airplane
weighed.

This module is the structural guard half of the fix (``CLAUDE.md`` required
practice 3: a single owner *plus* a drift test). The invariants:

* the partition is complete — wing items + beam stations == every item == W;
* the wing tie — ``Σ(items tagged wing) == 2 × (panel + concentrated)``, the two
  models of the same physical wing agreeing;
* the derived beam is what ``body_loads`` actually integrates;
* an untagged (pre-B1) file still loads, and its inference is conservative.

The three fixtures where the wing tie did **not** hold (wing-tank fuel inside an
undivided fuel row) were pinned open to the pound until design note 29 gave
``MassItem`` a ``wing_fraction``; the pin survives as the reduction gate
:func:`test_stripping_the_fraction_reopens_exactly_the_wing_tank_fuel`.
