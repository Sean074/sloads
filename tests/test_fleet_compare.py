"""Unit tests for the pure fleet-comparison helper (``sloads.fleet``).

The Aircraft Comparison page places one airplane against
``sloads/data/reference_aircraft.csv`` via this helper (GUI_design §8.4). The numeric
core is pure -- no pandas, no CSV, no Streamlit -- so these tests build a small
in-memory fleet fixture and assert the nearest-N ordering, the percentile band and
the outlier flags directly. The geometry fields (span / AR / seats, backlog F2) are
presentation-only, so a dedicated test proves they add no distance term.
