"""``sloads.derived`` -- the derived slices have one owner and stay current (#62, PB-1).

``Project.mass`` is WTONECG over ``weight.items``; storing it is a convenience
for its readers, not a second fact. These guards keep it that way: every
shipped example stores exactly what it derives (two had drifted by an ulp
under a changed summation before this file existed), the table names only
result slices the registry already excludes from the input set, and the
refresher is idempotent by value -- which is what lets the oracle form call it
on every render without dirtying a project it only visited.
