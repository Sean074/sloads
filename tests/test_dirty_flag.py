"""A render pass must not mutate the project (M2-3, review G4).

The sidebar's "Unsaved changes" flag is ``project_to_dict(p) != saved_snapshot``
(``app_shell/sidebar.py``). Two views used to *auto-seed* derived slices on every
render --
``flight_envelope`` wrote ``flight_loads`` and ``structural_speeds`` wrote
``speeds.mach_limit`` -- so merely visiting them tripped the dirty flag with zero
user edits and fired the discard-confirm dialog spuriously.

These views now persist only on an explicit **Apply** (``st.form_submit_button``),
computing the live diagram from an in-memory copy. This test drives each view via
``AppTest`` with **no widget interaction** and asserts the seeded project's
serialized form is byte-for-byte unchanged -- the regression guard for the fix.

**Every page owes this contract** (design note 32, OG-F). It was stated once
here and asserted twice, because the two front-ends were driven differently:
``app/`` had a file per view, and the surviving GUI has one renderer bound to a
step key. The file-per-view half retired at #270. Its fourteen pages were all failing this when the guard first reached them -- the
generic renderer attached a record to the project merely to give its widgets
somewhere to write, and rewrote every field it rendered, turning a JSON ``45``
into ``45.0``: the same number, a different file, and an "Unsaved changes" flag
the user never earned. Nine of fourteen pages tripped it on the fully-populated
oracle fixture. The fix is in ``oracle_app/form.py``: a created record stays
detached until the pass leaves something in it, and a write that would not change
the value does not happen. The pair of tests below is what pins it -- a render
changes nothing, **and** an edit still lands, because "never write" would pass
the first one on its own.
