"""The oracle GUI's acceptance gates (design note 32, step OG-D).

Three gates from the note, plus the guards the generic renderer needs to stay
honest:

* **G1 — no dual path.** ``oracle_app/`` imports its numbers from ``sloads`` and
  the shared shell only: no unit factor of its own, no arithmetic library, no
  private CSV writer. The second front-end exists to ask for less, not to
  recompute anything.
* **G2 — the page set is derived.** The rendered pages are exactly
  :func:`sloads.workflow.oracle_steps`, and no module in the GUI holds a literal
  list of step keys. Adding a ``bas`` to a workflow step must add a page with no
  edit to the GUI at all -- so the test that matters is not "the list is right"
  but "there is no list".
* **G6 — round-trip.** A project the oracle GUI would save opens in ``app/``
  unchanged, and re-saves byte-identically. OG-13's promise from the outside:
  one schema, two front-ends, no hop.

The smoke run is the one that earns its keep day to day: fourteen pages built
from one renderer means a single introspection mistake takes out every page, and
a registry row whose type the renderer cannot map is a crash rather than a
missing widget.
