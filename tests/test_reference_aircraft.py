"""Sanity-check the bundled reference-aircraft data set.

``sloads/data/reference_aircraft.csv`` feeds the fleet-comparison plots (the
Aircraft Comparison page: MTOW-vs-empty-weight, W/S-vs-W/P, and the geometric span / area /
AR scatters). It is reference data only (never enters a FAR computation), but a
malformed row would break the chart, so this test guards its shape and basic
physical plausibility without importing Streamlit or plotly.
