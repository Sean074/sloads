"""Net fuselage loads (Step C6, R6): the Ch 15 body distribution + sbeam export.

Ch 15 ("Net Fuselage Loads") ships no program and no printed station table, so
the fuselage net distribution is a modern calc validated by **equilibrium
closure**: the applied vertical loads (fuselage inertia + tail air load + wing
carry-through reaction) sum to zero, the running shear returns to zero at the aft
end, the terminal bending `Myy` returns to zero, and the exported FORCE set
re-sums to zero.

Moment closure (M4-1, closed 2026-08-03) follows the two passes of Ref 1 p103:
the terminal moment of the wing-reaction-free set is the unbalanced moment, and
it is reacted at the wing front/rear spar attachments. The closure suite below
locks both residuals, the `d -> 0` collapse onto the manual's literal two-point
solve, the node-count independence of the distributed form, and the flagged
whole-body fallback used when the spar stations are underivable.
