"""The Export zip against Appendix A: every file the bundle carries is named.

Review **CR-C-1**: the LRA beam model shipped inside the bundle from 0.6.0 with
no manifest row -- the F-D2 class ("an artifact the controlling document does
not name travels without a basis") re-opened one release later, on the newest
deliverable. The gate that should have caught it read the *manifest* against a
hand-kept set in ``test_report_content.SUMMARISED_IN``; nothing read the zip.
So the manifest and the bundle drifted apart in the one direction no test could
see, and a second sweep here found two more members in the same state: the
summary report's own ``.tex`` and ``.pdf``.

This module reads the artifact the user receives. ``sloads.report.bundle`` is
the single owner of the member list (the Export page loops over it), so the
names asserted below are the names in the downloaded zip, and every one of them
must resolve to a row of the rendered manifest table.
