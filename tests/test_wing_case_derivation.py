"""Deriving the wing structural cases from SELECT (Step M4-2, decisions 2 and 7).

``WingMassInput.cases`` used to be a hand-authored second entry of conditions
SELECT had already searched the V-n matrix for. M4-2 makes SELECT the authority:
an empty ``cases`` list derives from ``envelope.critical``.

**The gate (decision 7).** There is no printed oracle for the derivation, so the
benchmark-first requirement is met by a *closure* check instead: derive
``ga6_normal``'s wing cases from its own envelope and compare them against the
hand-typed values in the fixture, which are the Appendix A worked example's
printed figures (Ref 1 p217-221). Derivation never fires for ga6 in normal use
(its ``cases`` list is non-empty, so the Appendix A oracles are untouched by
construction) -- this test exists to check that the two routes *agree*, i.e. that
turning derivation on for a project would not quietly change the loads.

What it locks, and one thing it found
-------------------------------------
Nz and Nx agree closely for every shared condition. The air-load CL/V agree for
the balanced picks (PHAA, TORS). They do **not** agree for ACRL: SELECT's
23.349(a)(2) pick lands on a point whose own CL is ~1.30 at 117.4 kt, while the
worked example enters CL 1.55 at 116 kt for the same condition -- so a derived
ACRL case would carry a materially different air load. That divergence is
recorded as an open defect ("derived ACRL air-load point", docs/30_future/
00_backlog.md) rather than papered over with a loose tolerance here; the
hand-entered route is unaffected and remains what every shipped example uses.
