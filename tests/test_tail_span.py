"""The spanwise empennage distribution and its closed-form gates (plan 09 T2).

No printed oracle exists for a spanwise tail distribution — Appendix A stops at
the totals (SELECT) and the chordwise profile (TAILDIST). So the gate is
``CLAUDE.md`` practice 2's substitute: a **stated physics closure**, and here it
is an unusually strong one, because the chord-proportional shape (decision T-2)
makes every target *analytic*.

The five closures of plan 09 §4, each with its hand-derived target:

* **force** — Σ strip air load = ``LT25 + LT50``, exactly;
* **bending** — each half's root bending = ``L_half · ybar``, with ``ybar`` the
  half-planform area centroid, ``(b/3)(c_r + 2c_t)/(c_r + c_t)`` for a trapezoid;
* **centreline rolling** — net moment about the centreline = ``(L_RH − L_LH)·ybar``,
  which is **identically zero for every symmetric case** and the asymmetry moment
  for 23.427(a). This is the gate the full-span topology (T-8) buys and a
  per-side deck could not state;
* **torsion** — ``(LT25+LT50)·x̄_lra − LT25·x̄_25 − LT50·x̄_50``, area-weighted;
* **inertia** — Σ = ``−n·W_surf`` exactly, **signed by n alone** (T-9), with a
  companion test asserting a down-load case comes out *larger* in magnitude than
  air alone. That one pins the sign convention against the plausible-looking
  regression: a rule that opposes the air load would relieve exactly the
  conditions that size a GA h-tail.

Plus the reduction identity: with the LRA at 25 % chord the ``LT25`` torsion term
vanishes, the same property the wing's LRA transfer is pinned by.
