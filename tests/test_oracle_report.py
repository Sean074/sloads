"""The oracle technical report's content model (design note 44, §3 gates).

Assertions here are made against the **content model**, never by matching LaTeX
strings, for OR-6's reason: the document must be checkable independently of how
it is typeset, and a test that greps the ``.tex`` passes for the wrong reasons as
soon as the renderer changes a brace.

Gates covered: G-OR-2 (the derived section set), G-OR-6 (no concept content),
G-OR-7 (a half-filled project still yields a complete document), G-OR-10 (no
metadata reaches a number), G-OR-12 (the unit owner) and G-OR-18 (the gap states
stay distinguishable).

    table of negative ones -- which is what happened in the owner's review of
