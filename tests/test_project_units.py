"""Whole-project Imperial<->SI display conversion (Project JSON Editor page).

Guards the failure modes that matter for a field-name-driven converter:
a mass field (weight_lb, lbm) and a force field (load_lb, lbf) must use
*different* factors even though both end in "_lb", and the round trip through
project_dict_to_display/project_dict_to_imperial must be lossless (so Apply on
the editor page never silently drifts a project's numbers). Airspeed/altitude
must never be touched, per CLAUDE.md's aviation-standard-units decision.

**The completeness guard** (``test_every_numeric_project_field_is_classified``)
is the one that had been missing, and its absence is why ``EngineInput.thrust_lb``
shipped unclassified: it displayed raw pounds in the SI view while every
neighbour converted. A round-trip test cannot see that -- an unconverted field is
lossless in both directions -- and no fixture entered a thrust, so a
fixture-driven check could not see it either. The guard therefore walks the
**type graph** reachable from ``Project``, not the fixtures, so a field no
project has ever set is still covered the day it is added.

Its question was inverted on 2026-08-19. It used to ask *does this name look
dimensional?*, from a suffix regex, which meant a quantity whose name breaks the
suffix convention was invisible to the guard rather than reported by it --
thirty-four lengths and weights were, ``xt25`` and ``gross_weight`` among them.
It now asks the total question instead: **every numeric field is classified**,
converted or aviation-standard or dimensionless-with-a-reason, and a new one
fails here until somebody decides which.
