"""The summary report's content model (Step G8.4).

The report is the *controlling document* of a loads deliverable, so what these
tests pin is not formatting but the promises
``docs/10_standard/SUMMARY_REPORT.md`` makes to the analyst reading it:

* every required section exists (§4), and a section whose inputs are absent says
  so instead of vanishing or rendering an empty table (§3.4);
* every load is ULTIMATE, marked in its units string and accompanied by its
  safety factor and the station/case it occurs at (§3.1, §3.3);
* nothing is recomputed: the report's governing figures are literally
  ``governing_loads_table``'s, so the report and the pages cannot disagree (§5);
* the whole document honours the caller's unit system (§3.5).
