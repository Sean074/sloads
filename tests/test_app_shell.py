"""The app-layer shell has exactly one owner (design note 32, gate G8).

``app_shell/`` exists so a second front-end (the oracle GUI, note 32) cannot
grow its own copy of the project-file widget, the dirty guard, the units toggle
or the unit-input boundary. A prose rule would not survive that: the copy would
be added by whoever writes the second GUI, in a hurry, and nothing would fail.
So the rule is a test (``CLAUDE.md`` rule 3).

Three assertions, all live with one GUI and all sharper with two:

1. **No GUI package redefines a shell symbol.** This is G8 itself.
2. **The shell never imports a GUI package.** Without this the "single owner"
   is only nominal -- a shell that reaches back into ``app/`` is a component of
   that GUI wearing a shared name, and the second GUI would inherit the first
   one's pages.
3. **The GUI discovery actually finds something.** Assertions 1 and 2 are
   vacuous if :func:`_gui_dirs` returns nothing, which is exactly what a
   renamed directory would cause. The set is *derived* (a directory holding a
   Streamlit entry point) rather than hardcoded, so the day ``oracle_app/``
   lands it is covered without this file being touched -- the same
   derive-don't-list rule the nav guard follows.
