"""Gate G5, second leg — a project typed from blank through the oracle GUI's own
widgets is the reduced project (review 2026-08-22 PB-3, #62).

``test_oracle_inputs.py`` proves that a shipped example *reduced to the oracle
input set* still gives the original suite's numbers. It cannot prove that the
GUI can make such a project: the reduction is a deep copy with fields cleared,
and for a while it cleared less than it claimed (a stored ``mass`` slice
carried every gate while no oracle page wrote one). This leg closes that from
the other side. For each oracle page, in workflow order, the answer key is
rendered under ``AppTest`` and every value-bearing widget and every
``st.data_editor`` input frame is recorded; the same page is then rendered on
a project that started as ``Project(name=...)`` and the recorded values are
set through the widgets -- row counts first, then scalars, frames replayed
through the editor -- until nothing is left to set. When all fourteen pages
have been typed, the typed project must equal the reduced answer key:

* the serialised documents are identical (document metadata aside),
* every page's result blocks and download payloads are byte-identical, and
* a save → reload → re-run of the typed project is a fixed point.

Comparing against the **reduced** key rather than the full one is what makes
this the gate's second leg rather than a third claim: the first leg ties the
reduced key to the full one, and this ties the GUI to the reduced key, so the
declared divergences (the twins' turbine rotors) need stating once.

``AppTest`` cannot drive a ``data_editor`` (a canvas), so the harness swaps
``st.data_editor`` for a recorder/replayer around the real one -- the frame the
page *offers* is recorded from the answer render and handed back as the
*edited* frame on the typed render, which is the persist path the #35 tests
exercise as well.
