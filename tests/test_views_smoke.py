"""Smoke test: every Streamlit view (and the entrypoint) runs without raising.

Uses Streamlit's headless ``AppTest`` to execute each page with the GA-6 example
project seeded into session state, then asserts the script produced no uncaught
exception. This is a cheap regression guard for the GUI layer (which the pure-calc
tests don't cover): it would have caught, for example, a page still calling the
removed single-engine ``Project(engine=...)`` API after the multi-engine refactor.
