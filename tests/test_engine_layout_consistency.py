"""An engine layout that disagrees with the engine count (#66; review 2026-08-22 PB-7).

``engine_layout`` (``2W``: two engines on the wing) and ``engines`` are two
widgets on one page, set in either order. The constructor used to enforce
their agreement, so the in-session project accepted the disagreement, Save
wrote it, and the loader refused the file -- lost work. The rule now has one
owner, :meth:`Project.engine_layout_problem`, and three readers: the loader
flags (the file loads), the oracle page withholds its results, and the one
consumer of the layout refuses by name.
