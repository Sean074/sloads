"""Validate WTENV against the FAR 23 LOADS manual, Appendix A / Chapter 3.

The 6-place single's worked example (Ch 3 p21-22, with the structural CG points
echoed in the Appendix A FLTLOADS V-n table) gives:

* structural-limit stations  85.1 (aft gross), 77.49 (fwd gross), 72.64 (fwd
  regardless), from XLEMAC 63.641 + pct*MAC 69.246;
* minimum flight weight 2063 lb @ 73.09; maximum loading 3322 lb @ 84.56;
* ballast WEIGHTS 78 / 418 / 158 lb (aft gross / fwd gross / fwd regardless).

The ballast *stations* are matched where the manual's hand calc did not round the
limit station: forward gross 80.27 (±0.1%) and forward regardless 70.97 (±0.5%,
hand-calc rounding). The aft-gross ballast station is the *exact* moment balance
(~108.5), not the manual's hand-rounded 103.7 (which used the limit station 85.0
rather than 85.107); see the module docstring. The weight is the robust oracle.
