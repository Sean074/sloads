"""Structured load-case IDs (Step D1; unified at M4-2): uniqueness, stability,
one ID per physical condition, and the deck subcase map.

No calc-math change -- ``case_ref`` is an added field, not a value change; the
existing Appendix A/B oracle tests (unchanged, still passing) are the
math-fidelity check. This file checks the ID-assignment properties the design
promises: every delivered case gets a stable id, no two *different* physical
cases share one, the same physical condition gets the *same* id from every
module that delivers it, and re-running the same project yields byte-identical
ids.
