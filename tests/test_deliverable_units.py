"""Deliverable unit sets — M4-20 step 1.

Every deliverable renders in the unit system the user selected
(``docs/10_standard/00_program_overview.md`` §Units; ``SUMMARY_REPORT.md`` §3.5).
This file pins the unit *set* those writers will be handed, before any writer
consumes it:

* the **Imperial identity** — an all-1.0 set, so a writer needs no
  ``if system == IMPERIAL`` branch and Imperial output cannot drift;
* the **dimensional identity** ``moment == force × length`` for the solver
  channel, which is what stops an ``N·m`` moment reaching a deck whose GRIDs are
  in mm (decision D-19: a silent 1000× torsion error);
* the **aviation carve-out** — KEAS and altitude are never converted;
* a **standing guard** that every load unit the renderer knows has an SI mapping,
  so the next unit added without one fails here rather than shipping a mixed-unit
  table.
