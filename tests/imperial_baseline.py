"""The Imperial-output baseline: every deliverable channel, every example, digested.

M4-20 changed how every deliverable is written. Its central promise (decision
D-21) is that **Imperial output is unchanged** but for its new in-band unit
statement — a promise that is worth exactly as much as the test behind it.

This module builds the artifact set once, so the generator and the guard cannot
drift apart:

* :func:`artifacts` renders every channel for one example, in Imperial, with no
  header stamp (the stamp carries a tool version and would make the digest
  depend on the build rather than on the numbers).
* :func:`digests` reduces each to a SHA-256, and ``fixtures_imperial/digests.json``
  freezes them.

Digests rather than full copies: the six examples across ~10 channels each are
megabytes of near-identical CSV, and the question a guard has to answer is binary
("did any Imperial byte move?"). When one fails, regenerate locally and diff the
two renders — the frozen file tells you *that* it moved, and ``git diff`` on the
regenerated fixture tells you which channel.

Regenerate deliberately, never reflexively::

    .venv/bin/python tests/imperial_baseline.py     # rewrites the fixture

A regeneration is a claim that the change to Imperial output is intended. Say so
in the commit and in ``CHANGELOG.md``.
