"""Documentation-currency guards: no volatile literals in the standard docs, and
`docs/00_INDEX.md` ↔ the docs tree, both ways.

Two documentation defect classes kept shipping past the structural guards
(2026-08-15 review R6-D1…D8; `00_program_overview.md` said "schema currently 15"
while the constant was 52): a **number in prose that describes the code's
current state** (schema version, test count, coverage, "currently N"), and a
**doc file with no `00_INDEX.md` row** (or a row whose file is gone). Prose
cannot hold either current, so this asserts both — the same posture
`test_package_layout.py` takes for the package tree.

Scope is the *standard* — `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/00_INDEX.md`,
`docs/10_standard/`, `docs/20_theory/`. Plan notes, history and reviews are
dated statements and may carry any number; `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` is generated
and legitimately prints the schema version.

Stable facts are not volatile: `schema v46` as *provenance* ("added at v46")
never rots and is allowed; `SCHEMA_VERSION` next to a number is a claim about
*now* and is not. Rule text: `00_program_overview.md` §"Documentation currency".
