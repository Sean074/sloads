"""The empennage planform resolver and its drift guard (plan 09 T1).

The tail carries its geometry **twice**: as the scalar area/span the
oracle-locked modules have always read (SELECT, TAILDIST, BALLOADS), and — from
T1 — optionally as an ``"htail"``/``"vtail"`` planform in ``geometry.surfaces``,
which is what a spanwise strip integrator needs. Two representations of one
surface is exactly the situation that goes quietly wrong, so these tests gate the
three things that keep it from doing so:

1. an entered planform that disagrees with the scalars **fails loudly**, with the
   half/full bookkeeping applied correctly per surface (getting that backwards is
   a factor of two in every strip);
2. where no planform is entered, one is **derived and marked assumed** — never
   silently treated as input;
3. the new schema round-trips and every shipped fixture still loads.

#: every fin sat at ``z = 0``, which put ``ga6_normal``'s **below its own CG**
#: and reversed the sign of the roll moment a side load makes.
#:
#: T-8a moved three of them, and backlog Pri 1 moved the same three again by
#: giving the "fuselage-top" branch its body datum. The branch is now
#: ``z_centre(x_fin) + height(x_fin)/2`` -- the section-centre line
#: (``derived_geometry.fuselage_centreline``, note 24 R-4; defaulted from the
#: body-drag waterline and marked assumed on all three, since no fixture enters
#: ``z_centre``) plus half the **local** body height at the fin's ``xv25``.
#: The formula it replaced, ``root_waterline_z + fuselage_height/2``, read the
#: WING root as the body centreline (the substitution D-1 refuses), and on
#: these three high-wing types stacked half a body above the real top:
#: ``atr42_100`` 223.15 -> 191.17, ``dhc8_dash8`` 232.95 -> 203.45,
#: ``cessna_210`` 109.60 -> 100.24. That formula survives only as the
#: no-outline fallback, which is what still places ``ga6_normal`` (no fuselage
#: outline, ``fuselage_height`` 0, so it degrades to the wing root waterline
#: and says so).
#: ``ga6_normal`` **enters** its fin root since backlog Pri 1 (2026-08-17):
#: ``vtail_root_waterline_z = 78.5`` pins the value the fallback had been
#: producing, as a stated one, so that the body outline (and L-7) can land with
#: an attributable digest wave -- note 19 §10.2 (i). Zero movement, by design.
#: The three "fuselage-top" values moved in the fifth significant figure when
#: ``wing_geometry`` went to closed-form integration (2026-08-30): the branch
#: samples the body at the fin's own quarter-MAC station, which the strip sum
#: had been reporting with its discretisation error. ``cessna_210``
#: 100.2354943818504 -> 100.23507134905307, ``atr42_100`` 191.1672210589451 ->
#: 191.16490643871083, ``dhc8_dash8`` 203.4541778899263 -> 203.45108523980366 --
#: 0.0004 %, 0.0012 % and 0.0015 %, all toward the exact planform. The entered
