"""One engine out vertical-tail loads (Step C9): ONENGOUT.BAS port (FAR 23.367).

The printed Appendix B (10-place twin turboprop) one-engine-out oracle is **absent**
from the bundled references (Reference 1 carries only the Appendix A GA single; the FAA
User's Guide Ch 22 gives partial inputs and no output numbers). So C9 is locked at the
**sub-formula level** -- each algebraic step verified exactly against ONENGOUT.BAS
(engine thrust, windmill drag, AVT lift slope, EFFECTV, EF chart, density ratio) -- plus
**integration/physics closure** (recovery, yaw-rate peak, time-step convergence) and a
**refactor-parity** check that the shared v-tail helpers match SELECT's. The printed twin
oracle stays a deferred item.

The module was unrunnable on shipped data until 2026-08-13: ``atr42_100`` and
``dhc8_dash8`` entered the ``one_engine_out`` slice but no engine horsepower, so the whole
simulation path was exercised only on constructed inputs (backlog "ONENGOUT fixture data";
the ``tail_mass`` gap was the same class). Both fixtures now carry take-off and
max-continuous shaft power, and :func:`test_the_shipped_turboprops_execute_onengout` is the
gate that keeps the module's own deliverable path covered by CI.

Reference: ONENGOUT.BAS (Appendix C pp. 492-494); Reference 1 Ch 11 pp. 87-88;
