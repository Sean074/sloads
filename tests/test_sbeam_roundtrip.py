"""The round-trip gate: exported decks solved in the **real** sbeam.

Design note: ``docs/40_history/17_sbeam_roundtrip_ci_harness_plan.md``
(decisions S-1...S-9, assertions §4). Machinery:
:mod:`sloads.export.roundtrip`. Sibling gate, card-text only:
``tests/test_export_equilibrium.py``.

The mission's core claim is that *an exported deck solves in sbeam with verified
global equilibrium, continuously in CI*. Until this module that rested on a
manual check performed once, in 2026, and never repeated. What is new here is
not the physics -- the 2026-08-08 spike found the round trip already agreed
exactly -- but that it is now a standing gate: the day a card format, a GID
scheme, a unit factor or a case-control block drifts, this goes red.

Why a solver, when the card sum already closes
----------------------------------------------
``test_export_equilibrium`` re-derives each deck's resultant from its own card
text. That catches suppression, truncation, SID misrouting and an inconsistent
unit set. It cannot catch what only another program's reader can: a card sbeam
rejects, a ``LOAD`` id no ``SUBCASE`` selects, a GID that resolves to nothing, a
frame or sign convention that differs from the one the deck assumes. And it is
blind to whether the deck is *solvable* at all.

The strongest assertions here are the ones with two independent producers:

* **W-c / W-d** compare a solver-recovered internal load against the **NETLOADS
  quadrature** (``r.stations[...]``). The deck's cards come from
  ``wing_nodal_loads``, the target from the cumulative table -- different code.
* **B-c** does the same along the fuselage beam, station by station: sbeam
  reassembles the Ch 15 cumulative shear and bending from the ``FORCE`` cards
  and the ``GRID`` coordinates alone, and it must reproduce ``body_loads``'
  table. (The design note asked only for "aft-most element shear ~ 0" here; that
  turned out to be neither true nor meaningful -- the last element carries the
  last station's load -- while the whole-beam comparison is both, so it is what
  is asserted. See :func:`test_body_deck_recovers_the_cumulative_beam`.)
* **B-b** and the assembled leg target the constant **zero**, which no
  producer can bias.

Scope (S-2/S-3/S-4): ``ga6_normal`` + ``concept_regional_jet``, Imperial + SI,
across the wing stick deck, test-only body/tail wrappers, and the assembled
full-span deck; the wing leg adds ``atr42_100`` and ``concept_heavy`` for the
routes that pair cannot reach (see ``WING_MATRIX``). Control-surface decks are
permanently out -- their chordwise
``x`` is a fraction of chord with no chord length on the result, so there is no
geometry to solve (S-3).

Tolerances are :mod:`sloads.export.equilibrium`'s, not this file's, so the two
export gates can never disagree about what "equal" means.

#: *derived* CL/V route -- the route review F-C6 found broken and closed on

#: carries a second, differently-shaped concentrated item (a 600 lb store per

    The model is a tree, so cutting one element defines a free body, and the
    solver's CBAR end force in that element must equal the applied resultant
    of everything on the far side of the cut -- computed here from the deck's
    own cards by graph partition, with the element frame built from geometry
    (the step-13 sign map). Asserted at the two joints the deliverable exists
    to state: the wing side of body (first element outboard of the tagged SOB
    node) and the front-spar post (the forward-fuselage cantilever's last
    element, whose far side is everything BUT the forward body -- BM-2's sum,
    seen from the other end).
