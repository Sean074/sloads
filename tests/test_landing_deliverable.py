"""The delivered ground load: three wheels, a point each, and a named frame.

Design note 38 GF-6/GF-7 (#134), gates G-GF-6 and G-GF-7. What the replication
shipped before this was a magnitude in an unnamed frame: LANDLOAD prints its
whole matrix twice -- once with respect to the ground line, once with respect to
the airplane datum -- and ``run()`` emitted the first set only, with no
application point, no attitude and no frame label, while the export deck consumed
the second. A stress model consumes a force **and a point**; a magnitude with an
unnamed frame is not a load.

The gates here are, in order:

1. **Three legs on every case of every bundled example** -- nose, left main,
   right main, an unloaded gear at zero rather than omitted.
2. **The point is Appendix A's printed column**, per family (design note 39).
3. **The delivered forces sum to the page.** The three wheels' airplane-datum
   components reproduce p232's own printed force cells, and the NR/NV/ND load
   factors are that sum over the weight plus the rotated lift -- derived from the
   page and the manual's own formula, never from the module under test.
4. **The CSV/text split**, both ways: the delivered CSV carries the body frame
   only, and the text report keeps both sets.
5. **One caption owner** for the frame words, in both GUIs.

Reference: LANDLOAD.BAS (Appendix C p468) lines 5140/5230 (the two frame
banners) and the NV/ND/NNS loops; Appendix A p231 (FUSELAGE AXIS ANGLE, the
point-of-load column), p232 (the airplane-datum table and its NR/NV/ND columns,
transcribed 2026-08-29 -- design note 38 §1.13), p233.
