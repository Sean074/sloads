"""One owner for the V-n envelope and the critical set (review **F-C6**).

``select.default_envelope`` has been the declared owner of the "persisted
``Project.envelope``, else built from the flight-loads inputs" choice since M2R-8,
and ``select.default_critical`` is now its counterpart for
``Project.envelope.critical``. The reason it matters is one fact about the
pipeline: **``registry.run_all_modules`` never assigns ``Project.envelope``** --
and that is the path the Export page, the CLI and every deliverable take. So a
module that reads ``project.envelope`` directly does not get "the persisted
envelope when there is one"; on the deliverable path it gets ``None``, and
whatever it does next -- silently produce no cases, silently take a default load
factor, or raise on a case it could have resolved -- it does wrong.

That defect class has been found four times: ``tail_span._load_factor`` (fixed
2026-08-10 -- every exported tail deck had been taking ``n = 1.0``), then the four
sites this suite covers: ``net_loads._air_cl_v``, ``wing_inertia`` (×2),
``body_loads`` and ``balance``. Only the tail_span instance announced itself, and
only in a note.

Two kinds of gate here, per CLAUDE.md practice 3 (a cross-cutting convention gets
a code owner **plus** a drift guard):

* :func:`test_no_calc_code_reads_project_envelope_outside_the_owners` -- the drift
  guard. An AST scan of ``sloads/``: a new direct ``project.envelope`` read fails
  until its author routes it through the owner or adds the file to the allowlist
  below with a reason. A fifth instance of this class should not need a code
  review to find.
* the behaviour gates -- each of the four sites exercised on the path that was
  broken (no persisted envelope), plus the two edges the owner exists to get
  right: a persisted envelope must be *used* (``body_loads``), and a persisted
  envelope with an empty ``vn`` must not be mistaken for a real one (``balance``).
