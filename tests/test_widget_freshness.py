"""A loaded project must reach the widgets, and stale widgets must not overwrite it.

The defect (2026-08-21, backlog Pri 1 / issue #51 — the data-loss half of parked
**L-8d**). Streamlit widget state, once registered under a key, wins over the
``value=`` argument on every later rerun, and both GUIs key their widgets by
something stable across projects: the registry path in ``oracle_app/form.py``, a
hand-written name in ``app/views/``. ``adopt()`` replaced
``st.session_state["project"]`` and touched no widget key — so a page **visited
before** a load kept rendering its own retained state, and, because these
widgets persist what they return, wrote that state back over the project that
had just been loaded. Open the oracle GUI on the seed ``Project(name="")``,
visit Weight & Mass Properties, load ``atr42_100``: the page showed ``0`` / ``""``
/ 0 rows, the row-count widget held ``0``, and all 21 ``weight.items`` and all 8
``weight.cg_cases`` were popped out of the loaded project. Save from there and the file
on disk goes too.

The fix is one stamp on the key (:mod:`app_shell.widget_keys`), bumped by the
one function that means "the project was replaced". This module holds it to the
two halves of the contract, per page shape, and adds the guard that keeps new
widgets inside it:

* **render → adopt → re-render** leaves the session project equal to the loaded
  file (every oracle page, on every shipped example), and the widgets show the
  loaded values rather than the ones they held;
* the same for ``app/views/``, whose Apply step defers the overwrite rather
  than preventing it — the rationale parked L-8d rested on, which is why the
  sweep (practice 4) had to check it rather than assume it;
* **no input widget skips the stamp** — an AST walk over both GUIs, so the next
  widget added is fresh by construction instead of by review. Since #51's
  reopen (2026-08-22) that includes widgets with **no key at all**: an unkeyed
  widget's identity derives from its arguments, so its retained state survives
  a load whenever the loaded field repeats the seed — the common case, because
  the seed is ``Project(name="")``. The only exemptions are the shell's own
  session-state widgets, named per key with a companion that fails when an
  entry stops naming anything;
* **the sidebar survives a load intact** — the exemption list is the one part of
  the stamp a human decides, and #70 (PB-16) is what a wrong decision looks
  like: the unit radio was exempted as "the user's choice" when ``unit_system``
  is a field of the project, so a load could not change it and dirtied the file
  it had just read. The behavioural half below holds every shipped example to
  "loading a file leaves it clean", which no future exemption can argue past.
