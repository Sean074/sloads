"""A JSON ``null`` is refused where ``None`` is not a value (#121).

``sloads.io`` coerced numeric *containers* (#76) and said so in its own block
comment -- "Scalars are deliberately NOT in scope here". So a scalar ``null``
went straight through into whatever field it named: ``"full_down_aileron_deg":
null`` landed on a field declared ``float = 0.0``, the file loaded clean, and the
main GUI died three modules later at ``float(None)`` -- a raw ``TypeError`` out
of a ``st.number_input``, on a page the user had only opened.

The refusal is at the loader rather than at the widget on purpose. It is the one
boundary that maps JSON onto the dataclasses, so one guard there covers every
field and both GUIs, where hardening the ~137 ``float(...)`` calls in
``app/views`` would have covered one directory and rotted at the next widget
(rule 3 + rule 4). The alternative -- reading the null as the field's default --
is the silent zeroing ``test_the_limnz_derive_refuses_rather_than_resolving_to_zero``
already refuses for #122: the author's intent is not recoverable from the file.

The assertions are stated over the whole class, not over the field that found
it. Every scalar in every shipped example is nulled in turn, and the null must
either be **refused by name** or land as a **meaningful ``None``** on an
``Optional`` field -- never a traceback, and never quietly swallowed into the
default, which is the same defect wearing the other face.
