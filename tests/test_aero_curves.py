"""Aero-coefficient curves, the M4-5 closure gates and the entry checks.

Three things are pinned here:

1. **One authority for the polynomials.** ``sloads.aero_curves`` is what both the
   Aerodynamic Data page's curve and the FLTLOADS balance evaluate; the balance's
   stored ``VnPoint.cl`` must equal the module's evaluation exactly.
2. **The closure gates** (the benchmark-first requirement for this step, since no
   printed oracle covers a plot):
   - *recovered CL* -- inverting the balance rotation on each balanced point's own
     dimensional output must reproduce the polynomial CL. Algebraically identical
     within a converged point, so this is a **drift guard** with a 1e-9 tolerance;
     it fails if the curve and the balance ever stop evaluating the same thing.
   - *stall clamp* -- no balanced point may carry a CL above its Mach-adjusted
     stall CL by more than the balance's own convergence band (0.005). This one
     has numerical content: it fails when the dynamic-pressure iteration never
     reaches the stall line. The ATR-42 example fixture is a **documented**
     exceedance (Mach-cap-limited at 25,000 ft) and is pinned as such below.
3. **The coefficient-entry checks** in ``sloads.validation``: silent on every
   shipped fixture, one targeted perturbation per code.

def test_the_atr42_stall_exceedance_is_the_documented_mach_capped_one():
    """The ATR-42 example does *not* close -- deliberately pinned, not ignored.

    Five of its 180 balanced points (MAN A/C and AC ROLL at 25,000 ft) sit up to
    ~0.14 CL above the stall clamp because the local Mach is pinned at MC, so the
    dynamic-pressure iteration cannot raise q any further: the airplane cannot
    reach n = 2.5 at that altitude within its own Mach cap and CLmax. That is a
    property of the fixture's speeds/altitude set, not of this module. If it ever
    starts closing, delete this test and add the fixture to ``_CLOSING_FIXTURES``.

    **Decided 2026-08-18 (D-30, #13): this is ordinary flight, not a defect.** An
    airplane commonly cannot reach its manoeuvre load factor at altitude and is
    stall-limited through the speed range, and 23.333(b) says so: the manoeuvring
    envelope applies "except where limited by maximum (static) lift coefficients"
    (Ref 1 p62; Ref 2 §11.2.1.2 p68), so these points lie *outside* the envelope
    the rule defines rather than being design conditions the airplane misses. The
    Mach cap that produces them is the regulation's own provision too -- design
    speeds are EAS except 23.335 a.(4)'s compressibility-limited MC at altitudes
    where an MD is established (Ref 2 §7.2.1 p45-46), which is this fixture's
    MC = 0.4555. The point is still not re-reported at a reduced "attainable" n,
    but on conservatism and method consistency, *not* on an obligation to design
    to n = 2.5 there -- there is none. The earlier reading of this exceedance as "loads that are
    not physically attainable" is retired: the alpha iteration enforces
    ``nz = n``, so the load factor and the total ``n*W`` are exact and the whole
    effect is on the LZW/LT split (<= 0.5 % of ``n*W``). What *is* real is that
    the balance closes at alpha 14.1-16.3 deg against a fitted stall edge of
    13.18 deg, so CM and CD are extrapolated 0.9-3.1 deg past their fits; frozen
    at the fit edge instead, the published tail quantities move 3.3-44 % (LT),
    6.5-20.4 % (LT25/LT50) and 8.5-20.8 % (elevator load). None of the nine is
    SELECTed as a governing critical condition, so no sizing load moves anywhere
    -- but BALLOADS publishes all 300 points, so nine published rows carry the
    extrapolation unmarked (**#32**, band B). The solver's own silence -- both
    iteration loops returning their last iterate with no signal -- was **#33**,
    closed 2026-08-22: the balance now reports these nine as **clamped**, and
    ``tests/test_convergence.py::test_the_clamped_set_is_the_rows_the_published_numbers_also_flag``
    pins that its set is the same set this test recovers from the published CL.

    **It got roughly half way there on its own.** Pri 5 / D-26 corrected this
    fixture's CG cases to loadings its weight database can produce, and the
    exceedance fell from 7 points at +0.29 to 5 at +0.14 -- the cases are lighter
    and their CGs are where the airplane's mass actually puts them, so less lift
    is asked of the same Mach-capped q. Still not attainable, still pinned.

    **And back up with D-27 (2026-08-17):** the flight cases are the WTENV
    limit points now -- five of them, so 300 balanced points -- and 9 of them
    exceed, the worst ``MAN A`` at ``fwd gross`` (MTOW, forward-gross limit) at
    +0.27: three cases at full gross weight at 25,000 ft ask the most lift of
    the same Mach-capped q. Same cause, same altitude, still a property of the
    fixture's speeds/altitude set; the band below brackets it.
