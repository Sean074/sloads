"""The gear free body and the assembled ground cases -- step 10 piece 3.

Decisions **G-2**, **G-6**, **G-7/G-7a**, **G-8**, **G-12/G-12a** and **G-13** of
``docs/40_history/23_step10_ground_cases_plan.md``.

**This file holds the step's benchmark-first gate**, and it is worth saying what
makes it one. There is no printed oracle for an assembled ground case -- Appendix
A prints LANDLOAD's reactions, not an airplane in equilibrium -- so ``CLAUDE.md``
asks instead for "a stated physics-closure / invariant gate in CI, written with
the feature". The gate here is stronger than that phrasing usually buys, because
the two sides are computed by genuinely different routes:

* **sloads** assembles gear reactions, wing lift and the itemized mass model and
  solves a six-DOF rigid-body field on the assembled inertia tensor;
* **LANDLOAD** reaches ``NVP``/``NDP``/``NS`` and
  ``PITCHP``/``ROLLP``/``YAWP`` by lever arms and FAR percentages, with no mass
  matrix anywhere in it.

They agree to floating-point noise on every case of every fixture. That agreement
is content-carrying rather than self-referential, which is exactly what the
oracle rule exists to buy where an oracle exists.

The gate is in **two halves**, as G-6 wrote it. The translational half
(``test_the_ground_closure_reproduces_landload``) compares the solved load-factor
field with ``NVP``/``NDP``/``NS``; the rotational half
(``test_the_ground_closure_reproduces_landloads_unbalanced_moments``, R6-T1)
compares ``[I]{omega_dot}`` with the unbalanced moments, carrying the two
deliberate departures -- G-7a's distributed lift and G-12's contact patch -- in
the line rather than in the tolerance. The rotational half is also where the
frames stop agreeing with each other: see
``test_the_ground_roll_attitude_is_resolved_against_the_other_sign``.

def test_the_ground_closure_reproduces_landloads_unbalanced_moments(example):
    """**G-6's rotational half** -- the three lines the design note promised (R6-T1).

    The translational gate above is one half of what G-6 wrote down. This is the
    other::

        Iyy.theta_ddot == PITCHP + the G-7a lift term
        Ixx.phi_ddot   == ROLLP        Izz.psi_ddot == YAWP

    and it is the half worth having, because the rotational field is where the
    frame work happens: ``[I]{omega_dot}`` is a moment about the **mass
    centroid** in **body axes** on the **assembled tensor**, while
    ``PITCHP``/``ROLLP``/``YAWP`` are about the **CG** on the **ground line**
    from lever arms and FAR percentages. Every step of that transfer is written
    out here -- centroid to CG, patch to arm point, body axes to ground line --
    so a frame error lands on a named line instead of hiding in a tolerance.

    **The two deliberate departures are carried explicitly, not absorbed.**
    ``_lift_moment_about_cg`` rebuilds G-7a's ``L x W`` along the ground line and
    subtracts it, so if G-7 is ever changed without revisiting this gate the gate
    goes red -- which is exactly what the design note asked for. The patch-to-arm
    move is :data:`_PITCH_ARM_AT_THE_AXLE`.

    **Which frame each line is compared in is LANDLOAD's choice, and they are not
    the same choice** -- this is the gate's real finding, and it is about the
    oracle rather than about the port:

    * ``ROLLP = +-0.83 W x CP`` is built on ``CP``, the CG's height above the
      **contact line**, so the roll line is compared in the contact-line frame
      (``-GRA``) with the side loads left at the tyre;
    * ``YAWP = +-0.83 W x BP`` is built on ``BP``, an **axle** arm resolved
      through ``BETA``, so the yaw line is compared in the case's own ``rho``.

    Those are the same frame in every attitude, because ``rho == -GRA``.
    In the ground-roll attitude they differ by ``2 x GRA(2)`` -- 9.45 deg on
    ``ga6_normal`` -- because ``LANDLOAD.BAS`` resolves that attitude at
    ``PHIM = +BETA(2)`` where the level and tail-down attitudes use
    ``GAMMA - GRA(1)`` and ``-BETA(3)``. That inconsistency is McMaster's own,
    it is faithfully ported (see
    ``test_the_two_frames_round_trip_through_the_rotation``, which named it and
    declined to adjudicate it), and it is pinned as its own statement in
    :func:`test_the_ground_roll_attitude_is_resolved_against_the_other_sign`.

    **Tolerances, and their causes.** The one-wheel family's ``ROLLP``/``YAWP``
    are ``VMP x TREAD/2`` and ``-DMP x TREAD/2`` -- the tread arm is shared
    geometry, so those lines are identities and are asserted at ``rel_tol
    1e-9`` (measured: 4e-16). Every other line is compared against a lever arm
    the BASIC **truncates to 3 decimals when it prints it** (``LANDLOAD.BAS``
    780-790, ``landing._trunc3``), which is worth up to 2e-4 of the moment, so
    those are bounded at ``1e-4 x W x MAC``. The braked-roll family's pitch
    carries the frame difference above as well and is bounded at ``5e-2 x W x
    MAC`` -- measured 0.6-3.2 % on ``ga6_normal`` and 1e-5 on the regional jet,
    whose ``GRA(2)`` is zero and which therefore cannot see the inconsistency at
    all. Every bound is one-sided and every measured value is quoted, so a drift
    into the slack is visible rather than silent.

    A load and its point are one statement (design note 38 §1.14), and the way
    they come apart is a second construction of the point somewhere downstream:
    that is exactly how the deck ended up transferring from the patch while the
    manual applied at the axle, with an exact transfer and a green suite on both
    sides of the disagreement.

    So two things are asserted about the package's own source. Every **gear**
    ``transfer_couple`` call transfers from the owner's ``point`` and never from
    a patch; and ``contact_patch``/``_axle`` -- the two constructions
    :func:`application_point` chooses between -- are called nowhere outside
    ``gear_loads`` itself. Anything that needs a point reads
    ``application_point`` or a ``GearLegLoad``/``AppliedWheel`` field.

    The export channel's movers call the same rule on points that are not gear
    points at all (concentrated-mass offsets, LRA node routing), so the call-site
    half is scoped to ``gear_loads``. The *rule* itself is now singular: it was
