"""The id-band registry's guard: disjoint by proof, and blind to nothing.

Why this file exists is the whole point of the registry it guards. GID/EID/SID
bands used to be per-file constants with prose docstrings claiming disjointness,
checked by two tests that **hand-enumerated the bands they knew about**. The
balanced deck was written into ``4001+``, which the spanwise h-tail deck already
owned; both docstrings still claimed disjointness, neither test listed the new
family, and the collision lived for two months (review 2026-08-10 **F-C1**, root
cause **F-G3**). A deck that splices two unrelated loads onto one node is the
D-19 class -- parses cleanly, silently wrong.

So the guard here is written to have no list of its own:

* :func:`test_no_two_bands_overlap` walks :data:`sloads.export.bands.BANDS`
  pairwise. A band added to the registry is checked the moment it exists.
* :func:`test_every_export_base_constant_is_a_registered_band` walks the
  **module globals** of every module in ``sloads/export`` and requires each
  id-base constant to be a registered band's ``start``. This is the
  blind-spot killer: a new deck family that invents its own ``_FOO_GID_BASE``
  fails here even if nobody thinks to add it anywhere.
* :func:`test_allocators_come_out_of_their_own_band` ties each public allocator
  to the band that claims to own it, so the registry cannot drift from the code
  it documents.
