"""CONM2 / MASSSET mass export (step C1-C4) and the mass unit channel (C2).

Plan 12 (``docs/40_history/32_conm2_mass_export_plan.md``). The point of the whole
step is to break a circularity: the ``FORCE``/``MOMENT`` deck's inertia half is
computed by the same code that writes it, so nothing outside sloads can
contradict it. A ``CONM2`` set gives sbeam an *independently parsed* mass model
to disagree with.

What is gated here, and what is not
-----------------------------------
sbeam is not a dependency of this package, so CI cannot run it. These tests
cover everything that lives on the sloads side:

* the derivation reproduces each payload case's weight always, and its xcg/zcg
  exactly whenever a ballast row exists (it is solved from all three);
* the credibility gate, pinned per fixture -- a case needing 20 % of the airplane
  as ballast is reported, not exported;
* the mass channel's dimensional identities, in both unit systems (C-5);
* **no overlay card is left unreferenced** -- sbeam's baseline is every CONM2 no
  MASSSET names, so an unreferenced overlay silently joins every case;
* **no deck applies both the total load set and an accelerated mass set** (C-6).

The external half was verified by hand against sbeam's own parser and
grid-point-weight generator on 2026-08-08 and is recorded in the history entry --
the same precedent as C4's "the deck parses and solves in sbeam".
