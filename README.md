# sloads

A modern Python + Streamlit replication of the **FAR 23 LOADS** suite
(Hal C. McMaster, Aero Science Software) — the 22-program package that computes
the structural design loads a small aircraft must sustain under **FAR Part 23
Subpart C — Structure** — being grown into an **initial-concept distributed-loads
tool**: a `concept` mode that can exceed the FAR23 weight/seat limits, assessment
against similar airplanes, per-component distributed loads (wing / body / tail +
simplified control-surface distributions), and export to **sbeam** for structural
sizing. The FAR23 replication core stays validated against the manual; concept
mode is a superset of it. See
[`docs/30_future/01_concept_loads_plan.md`](docs/30_future/01_concept_loads_plan.md).

The codebase is a shared pure-calc package (`sloads`) plus a multi-page
Streamlit UI (`app/`) and a CLI (`cli.py`). A single reloadable `project.json`
carries every module's inputs; each module emits its own load-case CSV.

## Running

Install the package in editable mode (registers `sloads` and the `cli`
module on `sys.path`, so imports work from anywhere — including Streamlit):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'            # runtime deps + pytest, pytest-cov, ruff

streamlit run app/Home.py                                   # the multi-page UI
streamlit run oracle_app/Oracle.py                          # the oracle GUI (or: sloads-oracle)
sloads engine examples/ga6_normal.project.json -o engine_loads.csv   # CLI entry point
python cli.py engine examples/ga6_normal.project.json -o engine_loads.csv
pytest                                                      # the green-build gate
ruff check sloads/ cli.py oracle.py app/ app_shell/ oracle_app/ scripts/                   # lint
mypy                                                        # type check (sloads/)
```

`pyproject.toml` is the single dependency source — `pip install -e .` for the
runtime set, `pip install -e '.[dev]'` for the supported developer install (a
second `requirements.txt` list was deleted at 0.5.0 because it had drifted from
it). CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs ruff and pytest on Python 3.12 for
every pull request and every push to a `dev/**` milestone branch; the
3.10 / 3.11 compatibility legs run on the push to `main`.

## Validation & math fidelity

The math is **modernized** (`math.pi`, clean equations). The manual's printed
worked-example figures are used as **tolerance-based** regression oracles
(±0.1%), not exact oracles — see `docs/10_standard/PROJECT_GUIDE.md §6`. The oracle is
Reference 1 (`FAR23Loads_Code.pdf`, McMaster's theory manual). **Appendix A**
(6-place GA single, p131) is the printed oracle and is in hand; **Appendix B**
(10-place twin turboprop, p251) is **absent from the bundled PDF**, so modules with
GA-single figures are *oracle-locked* against Appendix A while twin/turboprop-only
cases (e.g. `one_engine_out`, the turbopropeller engine-mount case) are
*closure-locked* to the `.BAS` source with the printed twin oracle deferred. The
canonical, per-module validation status lives in
[`docs/20_theory/00_theory_sources.md` § Oracle status](docs/20_theory/00_theory_sources.md#oracle-status).

## Units

A sidebar toggle switches inputs and results between **Imperial** (lb, in, ft-lb,
hp) and **SI** (kg, mm, N·m, kW). It is purely a presentation layer: calculations
always run in the Imperial units of the original program (`sloads/units.py`
converts at the boundary). Saved project JSON is always canonical Imperial.

## Disclaimer

This project is an independent, modern **open replication** of the FAR23 loads
suite (DOT/FAA/AR-96/46; Hal C. McMaster's CAE theory manual, Aero Science
Software). It is intended as an educational and exploratory engineering tool,
validated against the worked examples printed in the reference manual.

It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with McGettrick
Structural Engineering, Inc. or DARcorporation**, whose "FAR 23 LOADS" is a
separate commercial product.

Results are **not certified** for safety-critical, regulated, or
certification structural design. The replication modernises the math (clean
equations, `math.pi`) and validates to a ±0.1% tolerance against the manual's
printed figures — it is not bit-for-bit identical to the original program.
Verify any results against the original suite, an established method, and
competent engineering judgement before relying on them for design or
airworthiness decisions.
