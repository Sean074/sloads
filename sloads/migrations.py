"""Schema gate: a ``project.json`` is read at the current version, or not at all.

**The rule (#93, 2026-08-25).** This project is pre-production. No analysis
performed with an earlier build has to stay readable, so a file is accepted only
when its ``schema_version`` is :data:`~sloads.models.SCHEMA_VERSION` or a
version the hop chain reaches it from (:data:`SUPPORTED_FLOOR`); anything
older, newer or unversioned raises :class:`SchemaVersionError` naming both
versions. Refusing is the honest answer — an old file's numbers were produced by
a different tool, and silently reshaping them into the current schema presents
them as this build's.

The gate lives here rather than in a front-end because
:func:`sloads.io.project_from_dict` funnels every load — CLI, both GUIs, every
test — through :func:`migrate`. One owner, one refusal, no GUI deciding
compatibility for itself. The standing guard is
``tests/test_app_shell.py::test_no_gui_decides_whether_a_file_is_readable``.

**The machinery is kept, empty.** :data:`MIGRATIONS` is a ``{from_version: hop}``
chain applied in ascending order, each hop turning a file of version *n* into
*n+1* shape:

    v_file --hop--> v_file+1 --hop--> ... --> SCHEMA_VERSION --> one tolerant reader

The chain holds one live hop today — the v55→v56 identity of note 36's additive
fields (OV-10, #97) — so :data:`SUPPORTED_FLOOR` is 55. At production the floor
drops to whatever version ships and hops register from there forward — the
shape of that work is unchanged.

**The twelve retired hops** (v18–v54, plus the v0 bare-``EngineInput`` branch
from the Phase-0 ``engloads`` era) covered every shape change from v18 to v55.
They are recorded, with the archaeology table that reconstructed which schema
version each legacy path belonged to, in
``docs/40_history/11_completed_development_to_0.5.0.md`` (M4-10) and in this
file's own git history. The six bundled examples were re-stamped through that
chain at the cut, verified output-neutral: the ``Project`` loaded from each old
file and from its re-stamped replacement are identical dicts, and
``tests/fixtures_imperial/digests.json`` did not move.

The examples are now the floor's only customers, so
``tests/test_schema_guards.py::test_every_bundled_example_is_written_at_the_current_version``
turns the next ``SCHEMA_VERSION`` bump into a red suite until they are re-stamped.

Pure: dicts in, dicts out, no I/O.
