"""The one registry of input fields: where each is edited, and where it came from.

Design note 32 decision **OG-14** — *one registry, not two*. Two separate tables
were planned: OG-5's field-**origin** registry (is this field an input of a named
`.BAS` program, or capability sloads added?) and the 2026-08-16 GUI review's
field-**ownership** registry (GR-INPUT-2 / GR-GEOM-2 / GR-GEOM-4: which slice
owns a field, which page edits it, and is this quantity stored twice?). They
share a key — the input field path — and differ only in their value columns, so
they are built once, here.

Six columns, keyed by dotted field path:

    path │ slice │ page │ origin │ quantity │ owner-or-derived-from

``slice`` is derived from the path, never stored. The other four are declared,
and every declaration carries a ``basis`` string citing what settles it — an
origin claim with no citation is exactly the kind of assertion this project does
not accept in the calc layer, and the same rule applies here.

**What this registry is *for*, so its guards stay honest:**

* **G4 — totality.** Every input field reachable from an oracle page carries an
  origin. :func:`schema_paths` walks ``Project`` from its dataclass types (not
  from an example project, whose ``None`` slices would hide fields), so adding a
  field to ``models/inputs.py`` fails the guard until it is classified here.
  That is the point: the classification is a decision, and a new field must not
  inherit one by default.
* **G5 — the reduced input set is real.** With only ``origin=ORIGINAL`` fields
  populated, every oracle-page module still runs and every Appendix A oracle
  still passes. Until that gate exists the "oracle GUI asks less" claim is an
  assertion; :func:`original_paths` is what it runs against.
* **The duplicate-owner class** (the review's five instances, `CLAUDE.md` rule
  4). ``quantity`` names the *physical* quantity a field holds, so two fields
  holding one quantity are visible; ``derived_from`` names the owner for the
  copies. One owner per quantity, and every copy names its sync — two assertions
  over one table, replacing five independent defect reports.

Guard: ``tests/test_field_registry.py``. Consumer: ``docs/generate_data_dict.py``
takes the per-field editing page from here rather than keeping its own
slice-level override table.

#: 2. **Demonstrably load-bearing** — omitting it changes an oracle-page result
#:    on a shipped example. That demonstration is gate G5 itself
#:    (``tests/test_oracle_inputs.py``), so the mark is never speculative.
#:
#: A ``SLOADS`` field meeting neither stays plain: the oracle GUI leaves it at

# How `origin` was decided, so the table can be audited rather than trusted

# Three kinds of in-repo evidence settle it, strongest first. Each row's
# ``basis`` says which one applies.
#
#  1. **A `.BAS` variable name in the field's own comment** (`models/inputs.py`):
#     SAAFT, DELTA, NG, D0..D4, ENGWT, TREAD, BLPROP... These are McMaster's
#     identifiers carried over at porting time, so the field *is* an input of
#     that program. Unambiguous.
#  2. **`PROGRAM_SPEC.md`'s per-module "Reads:"**, which restates UG Table 2.2.
#     Where it says a module's *only* upstream input is X (AILERON), fields
#     outside X are additions however plausible they look.
#  3. **A sloads step / decision tag** in the comment or class docstring — Step
#     C5/D5/E1/G1/G4/M2-6/M2-10, F25-2, L-7, plan 09, decision D-22/D-25, G-14.
#     A field the replication added carries the item that added it.
#
# Two standing rulings cover classes rather than rows:
#
#  * **Surface / set selectors are `sloads`** — `aileron_loads.surface`,
#    `speeds.wing_surface`, `aero_coeffs.*.name` and friends exist because this
#    model carries N surfaces where the original carried a fixed one. A **page
#    scalar** the oracle GUI resolves positionally and never asks (the flap page
#    means the flap). The ones it must still *write* to make a well-formed model
#    carry ``supplied=True`` (see :data:`SUPPLIED_RULE`) — building G5 showed
#    "never asks" and "never sets" are not the same claim, and the table was
#    only making the first one. The ruling stops at a **list row** (#98,
#    C210-46): a page cannot resolve which surface *each row* of
#    `tab_loads.tabs[]`, `tail_mass[]` or `aero.surfaces[]` belongs to, so
#    hiding the row's selector hardcodes it — every tab silently became an
#    h-tail tab. Row selectors are rendered (``supplied=True``, demonstrated
#    load-bearing in ``tests/test_oracle_inputs.py``), and the guard
#    ``tests/test_field_registry.py::test_a_list_row_selector_is_always_asked``
#    keeps the boundary.
#    The ruling covers selectors this model **created**; it does not cover a mode
#    the original program itself branched on. `engines[].engine_type` looks like
#    a selector and is not one: ENGLOADS ran a reciprocating and a turbine
#    branch, and every field of both (`ENGTORQ`, `CRUZTORQ`, `DT`, `CYL`) is
#    already `ORIGINAL` here — so the switch that chooses between them is too.
#  * **`origin` is about who *asked*, not who *computes*.** A field the original
#    entered directly and sloads now derives stays `ORIGINAL` and carries
#    ``derived_from`` (note 32, OG-7: an entered scalar wins and is marked). The
#    oracle GUI must still offer it; that is the whole point of OG-7.
