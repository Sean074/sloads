"""FAR 23 applicability detection (14 CFR 23.1, pre-Amdt 23-64 applicability band).

A pure, unit-testable helper that reports whether an airplane exceeds the FAR 23
applicability limits the replication core is calibrated to. It never blocks: the
GUI surfaces the returned exceedances as a non-blocking banner offering a switch to
concept mode (``app_shell/components.py``). On Appendix-A GA inputs it yields no
exceedances, so the tool reduces exactly to the oracle-locked FAR 23 behaviour.

The certificated limits live in :mod:`sloads.constants`; this module only reads
the ``Project`` and compares. No Streamlit, no file access.

    The unsymmetrical-load condition is driven by the yaw moment a failed engine
    leaves behind: ``thrust * bleng`` with ``bleng = abs(engine_cg[1])``. On an
    airplane with one engine, or with the failed engine on the centreline, that
    arm is **identically zero** -- so ONENGOUT integrated a transient with no
    forcing in it and reported zero tail load, zero yaw rate and, because nothing
    ever moved back, "NOT recovered within 60 s -- the airplane is uncontrollable
    at this speed (likely below VMC)". A false uncontrollability verdict on a
    condition the airplane cannot have (C210-43, #84).

    table, the module's refusal and the GUI's withheld form are three readers of
    **one** predicate rather than three copies of a rule (practice 3, the
    ``Project.engine_layout_problem`` shape).

    Deliberately **not** the whole of ``coverage._engine_failure_na``: that one
    also declares 23.367 inapplicable without a turbopropeller (Ref 1 Ch 11),
    which is a theory question about 23.367(b)'s reciprocating branch and is
    tracked separately. This predicate is the yaw-forcing one alone, and it is
    the one that produced the false verdict.

    With no engines entered at all the answer is ``None`` unless the layout
    settles it: an empty list is a project that is not finished, and the module's
