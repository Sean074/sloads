"""What the **oracle technical report** says, in the renderer-agnostic model.

Design note 44. This module owns the report's *content*: which sections exist,
what state each is in, and the front matter's prose. It emits no LaTeX -- that is
:mod:`sloads.report.oracle_latex` -- and it recomputes nothing: every number it
will eventually show comes from a ``ModuleResult`` the analysis already produced
(OR-6). Iteration 1 delivers the front matter (OR-31); the analysis sections
exist from the first commit as stated placeholders (OR-32).

**The section set is derived, never listed** (OR-2, gate G-OR-2). The owner is
:func:`sloads.workflow.oracle_steps`, and the rule is *a step is an analysis
section iff it produces a result* -- it has a ``module``. An input-only step
(``aero_coefficients`` today) has nothing to report and belongs to the input
sections, not to the analysis body. Adding a module-backed step to the workflow
therefore adds a section here with no edit to this file, which is the same
property note 32's G2 gives the GUI's page set.

**Numbering has one owner** and it is :func:`section_number`, derived from
position. Section references are built from it and never written as a literal --
a reference that does not move when a section is inserted above it is a reference
to the wrong section (``SUMMARY_REPORT.md`` §4.7, review F-R2).

    "analysis produced, reproduced here without recomputation, so that the "
    "document and the tool cannot disagree.",

    "The method is the FAR 23 LOADS suite of Hal C. McMaster (Aero Science "
    "Software), as replicated by sloads. The governing equations, and the "
    "worked example the replication is held to within 0.1 per cent, are given "
    "in the theory manual (reference/FAR23Loads_Code.pdf, Appendix A); the "
    "module data flow is described in DOT/FAA/AR-96/46 "
    "(reference/FAR23Loads_UserGuide.pdf, Table 2.2). The certification basis "
    "is 14 CFR Part 23 Subpart C.",

    "All delivered loads in this report are LIMIT. Every load case states the "
    "safety factor 14 CFR 23.303 prescribes for it and the basis of that "
    "factor; sloads applies it nowhere, here or in the exported deck, so it is "
    "the sizing analysis that applies it. The -ULT marker appears only on the "
    "two families the regulation prescribes already ultimate — 23.367(a)(2) "
    "engine torque and 23.561(b) emergency-landing inertia — which ask for "
    "nothing further. Quantities that are not loads take no factor at all.",
