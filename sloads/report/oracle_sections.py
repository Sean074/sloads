"""The oracle report's analysis sections, built from ``ModuleResult`` values.

Design note 44, OR-8 iteration 2. :mod:`sloads.report.oracle_content` owns the
document's *structure* -- which sections exist, what state each is in, how they
are numbered. This module owns their *content*: one builder per step key,
turning the result the analysis already produced into
:class:`sloads.report.content.Section` tables and figures. Each future OR-8
iteration adds a builder here rather than growing the structure module without
limit.

**Nothing here computes.** OR-6 makes the report a view: every number it prints
is a value some module returned, reproduced without re-derivation. The only
arithmetic is unit conversion and the ULTIMATE boundary, and neither is done
here either -- :func:`sloads.units.convert_results` and
:func:`sloads.report.render.ultimate_units` is their owner, and it is asked
rather than re-implemented. That is what makes G-OR-4 hold by construction: this
module never decides what a load is, so it cannot mark a load factor as one.

**Section 2 states no load in force or moment units.** Its load factors *are*
loads -- n is a limit load factor, and calling it otherwise is the error this
paragraph used to make (owner, 2026-08-30) -- but they are dimensionless and
LIMIT, so the ultimate boundary passes them through unscaled, as it does the
geometry, mass and speeds beside them. The tables are still routed through that
boundary rather than formatted by hand, because a section that formats its own
numbers is one that will eventually format a load it should have marked.

**Known upstream oddity, filed not yet fixed** (note 44 §10): a
``ConditionResult`` holding no load value still carries ``safety_factor = 1.5``,
because that is the dataclass default. No value is affected -- the boundary
scales by units and quantity, not by the stamp -- but a wing span has no safety
factor, and the owner has ruled that such a condition shall carry ``None``,
rendered "N/A". Until that lands, this module never prints a condition's SF, so
no section 2 table can inherit a claim that does not apply to it.
