"""The Export bundle's **member plan** -- the single owner of what the zip carries.

Why this is a module and not ten ``z.writestr`` calls in the Export page: the
bundle manifest (:func:`sloads.report.content._manifest_rows`, Appendix A) is
the controlling document's statement of *every file the bundle carries and on
what basis*, and until 2026-08-22 nothing compared the two. Three members had
drifted past the manifest by then -- the LRA beam model (review CR-C-1, the
F-D2 class re-opened one release later) and the summary report's own ``.tex``
and ``.pdf``, which the review's class-sweep missed.

A gate can only close that class for good if it reads **the artifact the user
receives**. So the page no longer decides the member list: it calls
:func:`bundle_members`, which is pure, Streamlit-free and importable by a test,
and every member states the manifest row that names it. The zip's namelist is
then a property of this module, and ``tests/test_bundle_manifest.py`` asserts
``{m.manifest_name} <= {manifest rows}`` on every fixture. Adding a member
without its manifest row is a test failure, not a silently unnamed file.

Manifest rows spell the project stem as ``<project>``; a real member spells it
out. :func:`manifest_name_for` is the one place that translation happens.
