"""The methods & limitations statement — one source, every export channel.

A loads deliverable that leaves this tool must carry its own basis. A CSV of
span loads forwarded to a stress engineer, a BDF handed to sbeam, a PDF filed in
a design review — each one has to say, *in band*, that the numbers are ULTIMATE,
what category they were computed under, how the tool is verified, and what it
does not do. An on-page caption does not travel with a downloaded file.

So the statement is built **once**, here, and wrapped for each channel
(decision G8-3):

* :func:`methods_statement` -- the full prose block (report §5, ``METHODS.txt``,
  the workbook's *Methods* sheet).
* :func:`csv_comment_block` -- the same, ``#``-prefixed, for a CSV header.
* :func:`bdf_comment_block` -- the same, ``$``-prefixed, for a NASTRAN deck.

**Units (M4-20 step 5).** The block states the bundle's unit system in band, so a
forwarded file never needs its units inferred from the magnitude of its numbers.
The statement is *bundle*-wide, not per-channel: one stamp is wrapped for every
channel, and the same block lands on both the human-readable CSVs (N*m, kPa) and
the sbeam decks (N*mm, MPa), so it names both sets and says which files use
which. Pass the same ``system`` the writers were given.

**Determinism.** Nothing here reads the clock. ``generated`` is a caller-supplied
string, omitted when ``None`` -- the GUI passes one, the tests do not. Two runs
of the same project must produce byte-identical output, or the ``.tex`` diff
between two revisions becomes unreadable and the tests turn flaky.

Pure: no I/O, no Streamlit. See ``docs/40_history/13_step_g8_summary_report_plan.md``
§5 for the content specification this implements.

    """The full methods & limitations statement for ``project``.

    ``channel`` states the basis of the file this stamp is going into (design
    note 48). Since note 49 OR-116 there is one basis and the default is it, so
    every stamped file -- deck, case index, gear report, per-module CSV, text
    report -- says LIMIT. A stamped file that
    travels on its own must state **its own** basis -- a bundle-wide sentence
    that was true of the deck and false of the CSV beside it is the F-R1 defect
    class, one level up (G8.3).

    ``generated`` is the caller's timestamp string (omitted when ``None`` -- see
    the module docstring on determinism). ``scope`` describes what this export
    contains ("full case set" / "governing case set"); ``deselected_case_ids``
    lists any case an opt-out filter removed, because an analyst must never
    silently receive a filtered set.

    ``system`` (M4-20 step 5) is the system the *bundle* was written in, and it
    must be the same value the writers were given -- this block is the in-band
    statement that makes a forwarded file self-describing, so a stamp that
    disagrees with its own numbers is worse than no stamp at all. It is the
    bundle's system, not a channel's: see :func:`_units_block`.
