"""The one resolver for weight/CG cases and the two design weights (step 10 piece 2).

Decisions **G-3**, **G-3a**, **G-4** and **G-14** of
``docs/40_history/23_step10_ground_cases_plan.md`` collapsed three case lists and
six representations of MTOW into one owner each. This module *is* that owner, and
required practice 3 is why it is a module rather than a paragraph: a cross-cutting
convention gets a single-source code owner **plus a drift guard**, never a prose
rule alone.

What it replaced, and why each was a defect rather than a duplication:

* ``FlightLoadsInput.cg_cases`` -- a derived copy of ``WeightInput.cg_cases``
  since v19, kept in step by the *Flight Envelope page* rather than by the model.
  A calc-only front end (the CLI, a test) could hold two different lists.
* ``LandingInput.cg_cases`` -- the one case list that never joined the SSOT,
  entered separately and consumed **positionally** by LANDLOAD
  (``wl[19] = wcg[0]*wr``), with the order recovered by matching names against
  ``validation.LANDING_CG_NAMES`` and *falling back to entry order*. A renamed
  case silently reordered an oracle-locked reaction table.
* ``landing.gross_weight_lb`` -- fell back to ``max(landing cg_cases)``, which is
  **MLW, not MTOW**: ``WR = GW/W = 1.0``, understating cases 13-24 (braked roll,
  side, supplementary nose) by ~5 %. Every shipped fixture set the field
  explicitly, so it never bit; the fallback leaves with the field.

Every consumer reads from here and none filters for itself.
