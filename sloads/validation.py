"""Input-consistency validation -- pure, unit-testable predicates over a Project.

A companion to :mod:`sloads.applicability`: where that module reports whether an
airplane exceeds the FAR 23 *applicability* band, this one reports whether the
definition inputs are self-consistent. Both are pure (no Streamlit, no file
access); the definition pages surface the returned warnings as ``st.warning``.

The checks are deliberately conservative -- each yields a warning only on a clear
inconsistency and is silent on well-formed input (in particular, it yields no
warnings on the Appendix-A GA fixture). Each :class:`ConsistencyWarning` carries a
``page`` tag so a view renders only the subset it owns (see
``consistency_warnings`` below and ``GUI_design.md`` §8.3).

Checks (14 CFR / Reference-1 context in each predicate):
- ``taper_gt_1``          -- taper ratio (tip/root chord) above 1 (WINGGEOM/TAU).
- ``nonpositive_area``    -- a wing/reference area that is zero or negative.
- ``le_te_ordering``      -- a surface whose leading edge is not forward of its
                             trailing edge, or edge polylines not ordered inboard->out.
- ``area_mismatch``       -- Configuration & Layout wing area disagreeing with the
                             WINGGEOM planform area by more than a tolerance.
- ``cg_outside_envelope`` -- the WTONECG centre of gravity outside the WTENV
                             structural CG envelope (14 CFR 23.23; Reference 1 Ch 3).
- ``cg_case_without_weight`` -- a weight/CG case stating no weight, which every
                             balance divides by (the flight envelope refuses to
                             run while one is present). See
                             ``_check_cg_cases_have_weight``.
- ``tail_cp_station_unset`` -- a FLIGHT case present with the tail
                             centre-of-pressure station (``xtc``/``xtf``) at its
                             load-bearing 0.0 default: a tail CP at the datum
                             sign-flips the tail arm and balances silently wrong
                             (C210-21). See ``_check_tail_cp_stations``;
                             ``flight_envelope.build_envelope`` refuses it by name.
- ``mass_item_outside_body`` -- a fuselage-carried weight item whose station lies
                             ahead of the fuselage outline's nose or behind its
                             tail (decision D-27, 2026-08-17): the three-view's
                             claim that the mass sits inside the body, made
                             structural. Fore/aft extent only -- wheels hang
                             below the belly and the three-section outline has
                             no height at a pointed nose, so ``y``/``z`` are
                             the sketch's to show, not this check's to refuse.
- ``operational_target_infeasible`` -- an operational placard target (VNE/VNO/VMO/
                             MMO/VFE) the chosen design speeds cannot achieve (M2-10;
                             14 CFR 23.1505/23.335(b)(4)). Advisory; no load changes.
- ``safety_factor_out_of_range`` -- a per-case limit->ultimate ``safety_factor``
                             outside the legal [1.0, 1.5] band (14 CFR 23.303;
                             the factor is owned by the load-case definition).
                             Advisory companion to ``io._safety_factor``'s
                             read-time coercion (M4-14).
- ``safety_factor_override_unknown_family`` / ``safety_factor_override_without_basis`` /
  ``safety_factor_override_out_of_range`` / ``safety_factor_below_regulation``
                          -- the governing safety-factor table's override layer
                             (M4-8 / decision G-11; 14 CFR 23.303). Every row is
                             user-editable, so an override must name a real family,
                             state a basis, and -- when it sits below the value the
                             regulation derives -- say so as a certification risk.
                             See ``_check_safety_factor_overrides``.
- ``aero_clmax_unreachable`` / ``aero_lift_slope_sign`` / ``aero_drag_negative`` /
  ``aero_drag_polar_shape`` / ``aero_clmax_neg_sign`` / ``aero_flap_neg_stall_unset``
                          -- coefficient-entry checks on the airplane-less-tail
                             polynomials (M4-5; Ref 1 Ch 7/Ch 8). See
                             ``_check_aero_coefficients``.
- ``flap_slipstream_skipped`` -- the FAR 23.457(b) slipstream band geometry
                             entered on the Flap Loads page with no engine record
                             to drive the term, so the slipstream case is skipped
                             and the flap is sized on the gust-combined load alone
                             (#83; Ref 1 Ch 17). See ``_check_flap_slipstream``.
- ``gross_ge_max_landing`` / ``landing_light_le_max`` / ``landing_cg_ordering`` /
  ``landing_cg_below_axle`` / ``landing_cg_names`` -- the LANDLOAD weight/CG
                             hierarchy (M4-17d; 14 CFR 23.473-23.499). See
                             ``_check_landing_hierarchy``.

Two public helpers here are *not* checks and are consumed by ``app/``:
``wtenv_cg_limits`` (the weight-agnostic structural CG hull) and
``wtenv_fwd_cg_limit_at_weight`` (the forward limit interpolated at one weight).
:func:`landing_reaction_warnings` is a **post-compute** sanity pass over a solved
LANDLOAD reaction table -- deliberately outside :func:`consistency_warnings`,
which must stay input-only so no definition page pays for a gear solve.

    Required practice 3: the case model is a cross-cutting convention, so it gets a

    * ``cg_case_no_analysis`` -- an empty ``analyses`` set. A case that is run for
      nothing is an entry error, not a state (G-3c): it silently disappears from
      every analysis while still occupying a row on the page.
    * ``cg_case_role_without_ground`` -- a ``role`` on a case not tagged ``GROUND``.
      The role is LANDLOAD's ordering contract; carried by a flight-only case it
      says the user meant one thing and the calc will do another.
    * ``ground_role_incomplete`` -- the ``GROUND`` cases do not carry exactly one of
      each role, so the landing module cannot run. Stated here as a page finding
      rather than only as the exception ``landing_role_cases`` raises.
    * ``weight_order_chain`` -- ``empty weight <= MLW <= MTOW <= sum(items)``, the one place
      four scattered checks became. The floor half is G-4's ("you must be able to
      land with reserves") and the ceiling half G-14's ("you cannot weigh more than
      everything you have"); violations are the fixture-data class this project
      keeps finding by accident.
    * ``mlw_below_landing_estimate`` -- MLW below ``OEW + max payload + reserve
      fuel``, meaning the airplane cannot land at MLW with full payload and
      reserves. Measured 2026-08-14 this fires on ``concept_regional_jet`` (31,000
      against 31,360) and on no other shipped fixture, which is why the estimate is
      a floor and not a prediction.
    * ``mtow_representation_drift`` -- a stored ``speeds.weight_lb`` or
      ``weight.envelope.gross_weight`` that disagrees with the MTOW SSOT. G-14 made

    ``flap_slipstream_skipped`` -- the Flap Loads page collects the slipstream
    band's geometry (AF, the nacelle/fuselage frontal area; BLPROP, the engine
    butt line) but the slipstream term itself needs the engine record's takeoff
    power and propeller diameter. With no such record the term is skipped: since
    #85 that is not merely a factor left unprinted but a **delivered case that
    does not exist**, so the flap and its attachments are sized on the
    gust-combined load alone. The manual's own example prints x1.407 (Ref 1
    Appendix A p201), so the omission is first-order.

    The predicate fires only when the geometry *was* entered, which is the
    evidence that a slipstream was intended. That is deliberate, and it is what
    keeps the check silent on airplanes with no propeller: ``EngineType`` has no
    jet member today, so ``concept_regional_jet``'s turbofans are recorded as
    TURBOPROP with a zero propeller diameter and are indistinguishable from an
    unentered piston record by engine type alone. A turbofan airplane leaves AF
    and BLPROP at zero and stays silent here; the schema gap is filed
    separately. The cost of that choice is stated plainly: an airplane that
    enters neither AF nor BLPROP and has no engine record still gets the
    understated load without a warning.

    The condition is read from :func:`sloads.modules.flap.slipstream_is_available`

    the behaviour it describes.
