"""Registry module name -> ``PROGRAM_SPEC.md`` section heading (R6-D6).

`PROGRAM_SPEC.md` is the per-module spec of record, but a registered module's
name and its spec heading are not the same string: the 22 ported programs are
sectioned under McMaster's original program names (``weight_estimate`` is
``WTESTIMA``), while the modern additions use their registry name. That
correspondence used to live only in a reader's head, which is how ``balance``
and ``tail_span`` -- the two most mission-central modules -- went without a
section at all.

This is that correspondence's single owner (``CLAUDE.md`` practice 3: a
cross-cutting convention gets a code owner **plus** a drift guard, never a prose
rule alone). ``tests/test_spec_coverage.py`` is the guard: every registered
module has a mapped heading, every mapped heading exists in the document, and
every heading in the document is either a module's or on the
:data:`NON_MODULE_SECTIONS` allowlist below.

The map is deliberately explicit rather than derived from the workflow graph:
``WorkflowStep.bas`` names the original program(s) per *step*, and a merged step
carries several (``"WTESTIMA+WTONECG+WTENV"``) while a folded module owns no
step at all -- so it cannot answer this question for every module.
