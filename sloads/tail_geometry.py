"""The empennage planform the spanwise strip integrator runs on (plan 09 T1).

Design note: ``docs/30_future/09_distributed_empennage_loads_plan.md`` decisions
**T-1** (reuse ``SurfaceInput``) and **T-8** (full-span h-tail bookkeeping).
Conventions: ``docs/10_standard/CONVENTIONS.md`` §1 (axes), §7 (single-source
owners).

Two representations of the same surface
---------------------------------------
The empennage has carried its geometry as **scalars** since the suite was ported
-- ``htail_area_sqft``/``htail_semispan_in`` on :class:`TailLoadsInput`,
``vtail_area_sqft``/``vtail_span_in`` on :class:`VTailLoadsInput` -- because that
is all SELECT, TAILDIST and BALLOADS ever needed. Those scalars are
**oracle-authoritative** and this module never overrides them.

A spanwise distribution needs more: a chord at every station. Decision T-1 gets
it by reusing the wing's ``SurfaceInput`` -- an ``"htail"`` / ``"vtail"`` entry in
``geometry.surfaces``, with the same LE/TE polylines, the same user-set
``elements`` station count and the same ``ref_axis_pct`` loads reference axis.
Where such an entry exists it is authoritative **for strips**, and the 1 %
validator below is the drift guard that keeps the two representations describing
one airplane.

The derived planform, and why it is marked rather than hidden
--------------------------------------------------------------
No shipped fixture carries tail polylines, and requiring them would mean
hand-entering planform data for six airplanes with no oracle to check it
against. So where the entry is absent this module **derives** a rectangular
planform from the authoritative scalars -- constant chord ``S/b``, leading edge
a quarter-chord ahead of the 25 %-MAC station -- which is precisely the
first-order derivation ``configuration.tail_planform`` has always used for the
three-view, and which that function's own docstring is careful to call "not a
structural surface definition".

It is not one here either, and the result says so: every derived planform sets
``assumed=True``, which travels into :class:`TailSpanResult`, the page, the CSV
and the deck ``$`` header. This is the established pattern for a value the tool
had to supply rather than read (``body_loads``' ``spars_assumed``,
``wing_geometry``'s assumed spar fractions) -- a first-order answer, delivered,
and never reported as input.

**What "assumed" costs, quantitatively.** The bending closure integrates the
half-planform area centroid, ``ybar = (b/3)(c_r + 2c_t)/(c_r + c_t)``: ``b/2``
for the rectangle assumed here, falling to ``b/3`` for a fully-tapered surface.
A real tapered tail therefore carries its load further inboard than this
assumption, so a derived planform is **conservative in root bending** -- but the
station-by-station distribution it delivers is not the surface's own. Enter the
polylines when the tail geometry is known.

Half and full, stated once (plan 09 §3.1)
------------------------------------------
``SurfaceInput`` polylines are defined on **one side** of a ``symmetric=True``
surface. The horizontal tail is symmetric, so ``2 x polyline_area`` compares
against ``htail_area_sqft`` and ``polyline_semispan`` against
``htail_semispan_in``. The vertical tail is a single surface: ``polyline_area``
compares against ``vtail_area_sqft`` and ``polyline_span`` against
``vtail_span_in``, with no factor anywhere. Getting this backwards is a factor of
two in every strip, which is why it is written down once, here, and used from
here.
