"""Flap loads, from FLAPLOAD.BAS (Reference 1 Ch 17).

The flaps are sized for the critical flaps-extended condition of FAR 23.345 /
23.457(a). The flap section lift is the wing-angle-of-attack contribution plus the
deflection contribution, both from Abbott & von Doenhoff Fig 98::

    D1 = -2.6*E + 2.6        (dCLf/d(delta), per rad)      E = flap chord / wing chord
    D2 =  0.59*E + 0.08      (dCLf/dCLw)
    CLf = D1*delta_rad + D2*CLw,   CLw = n*W/(Q*SW),   Q = V^2/295

evaluated for four conditions and the largest taken:

    1G stall (V=VSF) | 2G stall (V=sqrt(2)*VSF) | 2G at VF | NG-gust at VF
    LF = CLf * Q * SF                                       23.345(a)

The chordwise distribution tapers from the leading edge to half that pressure at
the trailing edge, so ``LE psi = LF / 0.75 / SF / 144``.

Two amplifications ride on the critical load, and both are **delivered as cases**,
not merely printed (#85):

* **Slipstream** (FAR 23.457(b)) -- a momentum-theory subroutine (FLAPLOAD.BAS
  sub 500) finds the fully-developed slipstream velocity ``U1`` that absorbs
  0.85*MAXHP, contracts the prop disk area to the flap and adds the nacelle/body
  frontal area to get the slipstream band (BL_eng +/- radius); the flap load in
  the slipstream is raised by ``(V_ss/VF)^2``.
* **Head-on 25 fps gust** (FAR 23.345(c)(1)) -- the load is raised by
  ``((VF_fps + 25)/VF_fps)^2``.

The two are **independent** worst cases (a head-on gust; full takeoff power at
VF), so they are enveloped, never multiplied: ``build_flap`` emits the
gust-combined case and, when the airplane has propeller power, the slipstream
case beside it. FLAPLOAD.BAS itself printed both factors and left the
application to the designer -- defensible for a printed report, not for a solver
deck, which was shipping the understated case.

VS/VSF/VF and the design weight come from ``Project.speeds`` (STRSPEED); the wing
area from the ``Project.geometry`` wing surface; the propeller MAXHP/diameter from
``Project.engines[0]``. The flap geometry is ``Project.flap_loads``.
