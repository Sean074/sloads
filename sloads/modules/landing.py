"""Landing / ground loads, from LGFACTOR.BAS and LANDLOAD.BAS (Reference 1 Ch 20).

Two programs cover the FAR Part 23 Subpart C ground-load conditions:

**LGFACTOR** (FAR 23.473(d)-(g)) estimates the landing load factor from the
drop-test work-energy balance. The limit descent velocity is the FAR 23.473(d)
formula ``V = 4.4*(W/S)^0.25`` clamped to ``7 <= V <= 10`` fps; the flat-tyre
deflection is ``(OD - hub)/6`` inches and the strut stroke ``SSTRUT``. With tyre
and strut energy efficiencies (0.3 tyre; 0.5 spring / 0.75 oleo) the airplane
load factor is the absorbed-energy ratio::

    N = [W*V^2/(2g) + W*(1-L)*(SSTRUT + d_tire)/12]
        / [W*(eta_tire*d_tire + eta_strut*SSTRUT)/12]

and the landing-gear factor is ``NLG = N - L``.

The *governing* pair the reaction solve runs at is owned by
``governing_load_factors`` (note 37): ``N`` is the entered
``landing.airplane_load_factor`` when filled (the manual's LANDLOAD runs at a
rounded design N -- 3.167 on p230), else the energy value, and ``NLG = N - L``
is always derived, so the wing lift factor moves the reaction. The FAR 23.473(g)
floors (``far23_473g_floor_violations``) refuse in a FAR 23 category and warn in
concept.

**LANDLOAD** (FAR 23.473-23.499) computes the tricycle-gear reaction loads for the
level (3-wheel and 2-wheel), tail-down, one-wheel, braked-roll, side and
supplementary-nose-wheel ground conditions. The drag load factor of FAR 23
Appendix C is scaled by the airplane/gear load-factor ratio to give drag as if no
lift were assumed (``K = NAP/NLG * K0``); the lever arms ``AP/BP/DP/CP`` of
Appendix C Fig C23.1 are formed for each attitude and CG, then the per-wheel
vertical / drag / side reactions follow per FAR section.

Reads the three explicit per-CG loadings as the **roled ``GROUND`` weight/CG
cases** of the one shared list (decision G-3/G-3a; required since M2-8 -- **not**
derived from ``Project.mass``, which this module does not read at all, so the
landing workflow step requires no ``mass`` slice: M4-17a), both design weights
from their single owners on ``WeightInput`` (G-4 / G-14), the gear strut geometry
from ``Project.geometry.landing_gear`` (Step G6b) and the wing area from
``Project.geometry`` when not given explicitly.
**Tricycle gear only** (UG Table 2.1).

``run`` emits the LGFACTOR condition, one critical-reaction summary per FAR ground
family, **and** the full 33-case reaction matrix, so the ULTIMATE deliverable
(CSV / Review / Export) carries every case the LIMIT analysis screen shows,
including the unbalanced moments and the ground-line inertia factors (M4-17e).

    in the unbalanced-moment tables -- and which is **not** a simple 3-cycle
    throughout:

    * **1-18** cycle the three loadings, so ``(m - 1) % 3``;
    * **19-24** are three loadings x **two drift directions** (23.485's inboard/
      outboard pair), so ``(m - 19) // 2``: cases 19/20 share the aft loading,
      21/22 the forward one, 23/24 the light one -- exactly what ``wl[19] =
      wl[20] = wcg[0]*wr`` and the ``((19,0),(20,0),(21,1),(22,1),(23,2),(24,2))``
      moment tables already say;
    * **25-33** are three loadings x three components, so ``(m - 25) // 3``.

    24, so on the side family it named the wrong loading on **five of six cases**
    -- case 21 is computed at the *forward max landing* loading and was reported
    against *fwd light*, and so on. ``cg_name`` was documented as cosmetic and
    the reactions themselves were always right, so no load ever moved; what moved
    is the label a reader joins the case to its loading by, and the ``CG`` column
    of the exported case index. Assembling these cases is what made it matter:
    the balanced case has to build its inertia set at the loading its reactions
    were computed at, and it asks here.

    stations -- the pair was degenerate and the nose-gear/braked-roll reactions were
    under-predicted. Callers must supply the three explicit stations (the WTENV
    structural fwd/aft CG limits are the intended source; see
    ``validation.wtenv_cg_limits`` and, for the forward limit read *at* the landing
    weight, ``validation.wtenv_fwd_cg_limit_at_weight``).

    The three are consumed **positionally** by ``landing_reactions``. Until step 10
    piece 2 that order was recovered by matching names against
    ``validation.LANDING_CG_NAMES``, falling back to entry order with a warning --
    a renamed case silently reordered an oracle-locked reaction table. It is now an
    explicit ``CgCase.role``, resolved by :func:`sloads.cg_cases.landing_role_cases`,
    which raises rather than reordering or padding. Any further ``GROUND``-tagged
    case without a role is assembled and distributed but never reaches here, so the
    tag can grow while this module keeps its exact three-loading contract."""

    * **The delivered load** -- for each of the three wheels (nose, left main,

      force ``Fx, Fy, Fz``, the location ``x, y, z`` it acts at, and the gear

      emitted at **zero** rather than omitted: which gears a family lifts clear
      is a fact about the case, and leaving it out makes the reader reconstruct
      it. The point is the manual's own printed column, not an inference -- see
      :func:`sloads.gear_loads.application_point_of` (design note 39).
    * **The airplane-datum scalars** -- the ``NR``/``NV``/``ND`` load factors of
      p232 and the unbalanced moments of p233's second table.
    * **The ground-line ("prime") set** -- the frame the manual prints and a gear

      in the text report and out of the delivered CSV (GF-6): the CSV is the
      body-frame deliverable, and the primed set is the analysis view beside it.

    Forces (``lb``) and moments (``lb-in``) are load quantities: ``report.py``
    marks them ``lbs-ULT`` / ``lb-in-ULT`` and scales them by the case
    ``safety_factor``. Locations (``in``), the fuselage-axis angle (``deg``) and
    the load factors (dimensionless) are **not** loads: they take no ``-ULT``
    marker, are never scaled, and render with a blank SF column.

    Cases 25-33 are the 23.499 supplementary-nose family: they have no main-wheel
