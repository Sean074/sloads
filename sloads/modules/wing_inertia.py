"""Wing inertia loads along the 25% chord, from WINGINER.BAS.

WINGINER computes the spanwise inertia load, shear, bending moment and torsion of
the wing (FAR 23.301(b): the air loads must be balanced by the inertia forces of
each item of mass). The outboard wing-panel mass is modelled as an area density
that tapers linearly from root to tip; the root density is iterated until the
integrated panel mass equals the entered panel weight (WINGINER.BAS lines
690-880). Concentrated wing masses (gear, engine, fuel, stores) are added as
spanwise steps.

Three unit distributions are formed along the quarter chord (airplane axes):

* **1g vertical** -- ``Fz = W``; ``Sz`` cumulative; ``Mxx = Σ Sz·dy``; torsion
  ``Tyy = −Σ Sz·Δx25 − Σ W·(x50−x25)`` (lines 950-1110);
* **1g drag** -- ``Fx = W``; ``Sx`` cumulative; ``Mzz = Σ Sx·dy``; torsion from the
  mass Z offset ``Σ Sx·Δz`` (lines 1150-1310);
* **unit roll** (100 000 in-lb) -- ``Fz = W·Y·1e5/Iwxx`` with ``Iwxx = 2·Σ W·Y²``,
  integrated like the vertical case (lines 1350-1610).

For a condition ``(Nz, Nx, unbalanced rolling moment)`` they combine (lines
1740-1820): ``Fz = Nz·W + UNB/1e5·Fz_roll``, ``Fx = Nx·W``, and likewise for the
shears/moments; torsion ``Myy = Nz·Tyy + Nx·Tvyy + UNB/1e5·Tuyy``. The signs are
entered so the inertia acts opposite the air load (up and aft positive), i.e.
``Nz`` is the negative of the air-load load factor -- NETLOADS then *adds* air and
inertia.

    filled the table, and the *Wing Loads* page's "pull from SELECT" button
    materialises the same list into the editable table so the engineer can see
    and override it.

    **Limitation:** a derived ACRL case carries ``unbal_moment = 0`` -- SELECT's
    condition does not name an unbalanced rolling moment (it comes from AILERON,
    Ref 1 Ch 13). Enter the case explicitly to give one.

    named this condition, its :class:`CaseRef`'s ``case_id`` is kept -- the
    spanwise distribution WINGINER/NETLOADS produce is another deliverable of the
    same case, not a second case, which is exactly what
    ``sbeam_bridge.case_index_rows_from``'s dedupe-by-``case_id`` assumes. Failing
    that (SELECT not run, or a case the engineer added by hand), the ID comes from
    the fixed ``case_ids.WING_SLOTS`` table by **name** -- so ``PHAA`` is ``W-01``
    either way -- and a name outside the table takes the next
    ``case_ids.WING_BAND_EXTRA`` slot.

    **The flight condition is the case's own** (user decision 2026-08-13): where
    ``WingLoadCase`` states a ``v_eas_kt``, that speed is what the loads were
    computed at (``net_loads._air_cl_v``), so it is the speed the row states --
    even when SELECT named the same condition at a different V-n point. On
    ``atr42_100`` the fixture enters ``PHAA`` at 170 kt while SELECT's ``PHAA``
    point is 185.85 kt (``balance.py`` records the same divergence), and before
    this the case-index row read 185.9 kt beside loads built at 170. CG, altitude
    and the FAR reference stay SELECT's: the case states none of them, and they
    are properties of the physical condition the shared ``case_id`` names.

    Still a **pure function** of the project and the case's position, not a
    stateful allocator, so ``wing_inertia.py`` and ``net_loads.py`` -- two
    independent modules iterating the same list -- agree on the identical
    ``CaseRef`` without sharing runtime state.
