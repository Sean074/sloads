"""Balanced-tail-load verification utility (BALLOADS.BAS, Reference 1 Ch 8-9).

BALLOADS is an **off-pipeline cross-check**, not a main-pipeline module. After
FLTLOADS balances the V-n envelope with an *approximate* horizontal-tail centre of
pressure (``XTC`` ~5% tail MAC flaps-up, ``XTF`` ~25% flaps-down; Ch 8
"Assumption"), BALLOADS recomputes the balancing load **rationally** -- resolving
it into the angle-of-attack load at 25% tail MAC (``LT25``) and the camber/elevator
load at 50% (``LT50``) -- to verify that the approximate CP was adequate.

The rational balance equations live in :func:`sloads.modules.select.htail_balance`
(oracle-locked in Step C6); per the project convention this utility **reuses** that
routine rather than re-deriving it, so the verification can never silently drift
from the production balance. BALLOADS' contribution is the *comparison*: for each
balanced V-n condition it converts the rational CP (% tail MAC) back to a fuselage
station ``XT_rational`` and reports it against FLTLOADS' assumed ``XTC``/``XTF``.

It also makes the Ch 9 teaching point that the elevator load is **not** always
opposite the stabilizer load: the per-condition elevator load (reusing SELECT's
:func:`elevator_load`) is reported alongside the total.

Validation: Appendix A / Ch 9 case-202 hand-calc -- the up balancing load with
flaps retracted is ``LT = 519.845 lb`` (LT25 +907.62, LT50 -387.78, elevator
deflection -5.39 deg, CP 6.35% tail MAC), matching SELECT's rational result.
