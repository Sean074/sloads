"""Net fuselage loads -- the body analogue of NETLOADS (Reference 1 Ch 15).

Ch 15 ("Net Fuselage Loads") gives a *suggested procedure* rather than a ported
``.BAS`` program: the fuselage is a simple beam carrying the inertia of the
fuselage mass items reacted by the air load on the tail and the wing-attach
reactions. For each critical fuselage condition (selected by SELECT, R5) this
module follows the two passes of Ref 1 p103:

  1. multiplies each fuselage station weight by the linear load factor ``NZ`` to
     get its inertia force (``fz = -NZ*w``, down for positive NZ);
  2. applies the balancing tail air load ``LT`` at the tail station;
  3. integrates nose->tail to the running shear ``Sz`` and bending ``Myy``; the
     terminal moment of *that* set is the **unbalanced moment** ``M_ub``
     ("the moment at the aft end is the unbalanced moment", p103);
  4. reacts ``M_ub`` -- and the residual vertical force ``R_total = NZ*W_fus -
     LT`` -- at the wing **front and rear spar attachments**, then re-integrates
     the whole set ("the unbalanced moment is reacted by the wing at the front
     and rear spar attachments ... recalculate the loads, shear and moments").

There is **no printed station-by-station oracle** (Ch 15 ships no program), so the
result is validated by **equilibrium closure**: the applied vertical force sums to
zero, the shear returns to ~0 at the aft end, and the terminal ``Myy`` is ~0
(moment closure -- backlog M4-1, closed 2026-08-03). The fuselage station weights
(``Project.fuselage_mass``) should already exclude the wing mass outside the
fuselage, per Ch 15.

**The distributed carry-through reaction is a refinement of p103, ours and not
the manual's.** p103 prescribes two point reactions; applied literally they put a
``+/-M_ub/d`` shear spike across a short carry-through. The two reactions are
therefore applied as the statically equivalent **linear distribution over
``[x_f, x_r]``** -- identical resultant and first moment, no spike, and it
collapses continuously onto the manual's two-point solve as ``d -> 0``. (The
manual's own Bruhn Ch A5 pointer is about beaming the *inertia* loads into the
adjacent frames, so it is precedent for diffusing discrete loads into structure,
not authority for this particular shape.) The reactions ``R_f``/``R_r`` are still
reported as the fitting loads; they are *not* applied on top of the distribution,
which already carries them. The options trade is in
``docs/40_history/04_m4-1_body_moment_closure.md``.

The spar stations come from :func:`sloads.derived_geometry.carry_through`. When
they are underivable (no wing surface, degenerate root chord) the module falls
back to a whole-body self-equilibrated linear correction: it still closes the
beam, but the correction has **no physical source** -- it relieves the wing
region and loads the tail cone with a moment nothing applies there. Such a result
is flagged ``closure_artifact`` and carries :data:`CLOSURE_ARTIFACT_CAVEAT` onto
every deliverable.

Still open, split out of M4-1: the **pitching** half of p103's "linear and
pitching load factors" (**M4-21**; ``theta_ddot = 0`` on these balanced trim
cases, so it does not affect this closure) and the distributed body aero moment
(**M4-19**).

Coordinates are the airplane body axes (fuselage station X aft, waterline Z up),
pounds and inch-pounds.
