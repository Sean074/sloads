"""Pure engine-mount load calculations, ported from ENGLOADS.BAS.

Every function takes an :class:`EngineInput` and returns one or more

Sign convention: the engine-mount torque is reported in the sense
"clockwise from the pilot's view is positive", which is also the sense used for
rotor RPM and stoppage torque. It is **negative for a propeller turning
clockwise from that seat**, because that is the torque the engine delivers to

``EngineInput.prop_direction`` reaches a published load (design note 53, under

# An *additive* superset enabled by ``Project.include_far25``. The FAR 23 core
# above is untouched and stays oracle-locked; these append on top. Ported from
# 14 CFR 25.361 / 25.371 (see ``reference/14CFR_Part25_engine_torque.md``).
#
# Scope: turbopropeller engines only. 25.361(a)(2) defines a limit-torque factor
# only for turbopropeller (1.25 x mean torque) and "other turbine engines"
# (= max accelerating torque); it is silent on reciprocating engines, and this
# tool's mass/gyro math is propeller-centric. No McMaster worked example exists
# for Part 25, so these are formula-closure checked, not locked to a printed
# figure (the LANDLOAD precedent).
#
# *Reduced to the non-duplicative cases only.* After the AC 23-19A correction to
# 23.361(a)(1) (which factors the takeoff torque), the FAR 25 torque cases
# 25.361(a)(1)(i)/(ii)/(iii) became bit-for-bit duplicates of the corrected
# 23.361(a)(1)/(a)(2)/(a)(3) for a turbopropeller, so they were removed. What
# remains is genuinely additive over the FAR 23 set:
#   - 25.361(a)(3)(ii) maximum engine acceleration torque -- no FAR 23 analog;
#   - 25.361(a)(3)(i) sudden stoppage combined with a simultaneous 1g vertical
#     load (23.361(b)(1) reports the torque alone);
#   - 25.371 gyroscopic loads using the project's A2 limit load factor for the
#     simultaneous vertical (23.371(b) uses the fixed 2.5g of the oracle).
# These stay behind the opt-in flag (off for any GA/oracle run) so the FAR 23
# Appendix A/B outputs are unchanged -- making them unconditional would alter the
# Appendix B turboprop case count and gyro vertical, breaking oracle-lock.
