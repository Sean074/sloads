"""Critical-load selection (SELECT.BAS, Reference 1 Ch 9).

SELECT reads the balanced V-n matrix produced by FLTLOADS and searches it for the
governing (critical) load on each major component (wing, horizontal tail, vertical
tail, fuselage). This module implements the **wing** critical-load search
(SELECT.BAS subroutine 3000, lines 2990-3540), which feeds the AIRLOADS<->SELECT
iteration and WINGINER/NETLOADS:

  PHAA  largest resultant wing load sqrt(LZW^2 + DX^2) among STALL +N / MAN A
        (positive high angle of attack; FAR 23.333(b))
  PLAA  largest resultant among MAN D / GUST D
        (positive low angle of attack; FAR 23.333(b))
  PMAA  largest LZW among MAN C / GUST +C
        (positive medium angle of attack; FAR 23.333(c) or (b))
  NMAA  largest resultant among the negative maneuver/gust points
        (STALL -N, MAN -C, MAN -D, GUST -C, GUST -D; FAR 23.333(c) or (b))
  ACRL  largest LZW among the accelerated-roll points (FAR 23.349(a))
  TORS  steady-roll condition with the most negative aileron-induced torsion proxy
        (CM - 0.01*aileron_deg)*G*V^2 among ST ROL A/C/D, with the aileron
        deflection per CAM 3.222 (DA at VA, DC = (VA/VC)*DA at VC,
        DD = 0.5*(VA/VD)*DA at VD; FAR 23.349(b))

The selected conditions become ``Project.envelope.critical`` -- the set AIRLOADS
re-evaluates for distributed airloads and WINGINER/NETLOADS combine with inertia.
``LZW`` is the wing lift normal to the airplane reference (less tail) and ``DX``
the airplane drag, both read from each :class:`VnPoint`.

It also computes the **rational horizontal-tail balancing loads** (Ch 9 "Balancing
Tail Loads" / BALLOADS method) when ``Project.tail_loads`` is present: for every
balanced V-n point it resolves the total balanced tail load into the angle-of-
attack load at 25% tail MAC and the camber (elevator) load at 50%, then selects the
largest up and largest down balancing load with flaps retracted (FAR 23.421). This
refines FLTLOADS' approximate tail CP rationally.

When ``Project.vtail_loads`` is present it also computes the four critical
**vertical-tail** loads (Ch 9 / SELECT.BAS subroutine 8300), searched over the V-n
``BAL A`` (VA) and ``BAL C`` (VC) points: sudden full rudder deflection
(FAR 23.441(a)(1)), yaw to a 19.5 deg sideslip with the rudder held
(FAR 23.441(a)(2)), a 15 deg yaw with the rudder neutral (FAR 23.441(a)(3)) and the
lateral gust at VC (FAR 23.443(b)).

The remaining horizontal-tail conditions (unchecked/checked maneuver, gust,
unsymmetrical), the flaps-extended balancing (which needs the flapped V-n envelope,
not yet built) and the fuselage net loads are later C6 increments.

    symmetric tail load, 100% on one side and 100 - 10*(n-1) percent on the other.

    Approved oracle deviation (M1-4, approved 2026-07-20). SELECT.BAS builds a
    12-condition candidate array (lines 6030-6140) that **includes** the unchecked
    maneuvers (``L(5)=U1CK`` / ``L(6)=U2CK``) and searches all of them for the
    largest magnitude (``FOR I=1 TO 12`` at 6150-6175). 23.427(a) itself applies the
    unsymmetrical distribution to "the loads prescribed in 23.421 **through** 23.425"
    -- which spans 23.423, the unchecked maneuver. Earlier revisions of this module
    filtered the unchecked cases out (citing a CAM 3.216 rationale); that was an
    undocumented, non-conservative deviation from the BASIC and is removed here.

    The unchecked maneuver is frequently the largest H-tail load: on the Appendix A
    GA6 it governs (DN UNCHECKED, ~-1400 lb) over the down gust (-1292.8), so the
    unsymmetrical total moves from the Appendix A printout's -1111.8 to ~-1204.7.
    That printout is itself inconsistent with the Appendix C listing (it selected
    GUST -C, which the listing's full search would not) -- it was produced by a
    superseded SELECT.BAS that excluded the unchecked cases, i.e. the very behavior
    removed here. The listing + 23.427(a) are authoritative; the sample output is not.

    Sign: SELECT.BAS 6180 sets ``RHSIDE = .5*HTMAX*SGN(LT(HZCASE))`` -- half the
    governing magnitude, signed by the source case's balanced tail load. For the
    governing conditions that sign coincides with the condition's own total-load
    sign (verified against Appendix A), so ``rh = 0.5 * total`` reproduces it.
