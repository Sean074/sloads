"""Structural design speeds & limit maneuver load factors, from STRSPEED.BAS.

STRSPEED chooses the certification category (normal/utility/acrobatic) and
computes the FAR 23.335 minimum design airspeeds and the FAR 23.337 limit
maneuver load factors, then verifies the chosen speeds meet those minimums
(raising them if not). It also reports the cruise/dive Mach numbers at the
shoulder altitude (the dividing line with MACHLIM). All speeds are knots
equivalent airspeed (KEAS). Reference 1 Ch 6.

Equations (Ch 6):
    n      = 2.1 + 24000/(W+10000), capped 3.8 (N), or 4.4 (U), 6.0 (A)
    n_neg  = -0.4*n (N/U) or -0.5*n (A)
    VC_min = K_c*(W/S)**0.5         [<= 0.9*VH]          K_c by category
    VD_min = max(K_d*VCmin, 1.25*VC)                      K_d by category
    VA_min = VS*sqrt(n)             [<= VC]
    VF_min = max(1.4*VS, 1.8*VSF)
    VS     = sqrt(295*(W/S)/CLmax_clean),  VSF = sqrt(295*(W/S)/CLmax_flap)
    MC     = VC/(sqrt(sigma)*a),  MD = VD/(sqrt(sigma)*a)  at the shoulder altitude

The clean/flapped stall speeds VS/VSF are DERIVED from the maximum lift
coefficients on ``Project.aero_coeffs`` (``clmax_clean``/``clmax_flap``) at the
design weight -- CLmax is entered once and is the single stall source (M1-1b;
User's Guide p7-5). VS/VSF then set VA and VF.

FAR 23.335(b) imposes both dive-speed minimums: VD >= max(K_d*VCmin, 1.25*VC),
where the K_d term uses the *minimum* cruise VCmin (STRSPEED.BAS V2DMIN=K2*V1CMIN,
lines 380/390). With no chosen speeds the K_d*VCmin term governs (Appendix A p155,
Cat N: 198.53 kt). For the worked chosen-speeds example (p156) the chosen VD 212.5
already clears both floors, which is why the absolute 1.25*VC floor is what shows.
Concept mode (Cat C) treats the GA-calibrated K_d term as advisory only.

**The dive-speed basis (F25-2).** ``1.25*VC`` is algebraically 25.335(b)'s first
route, ``VC/MC <= 0.8*VD/MD`` -- so what the paragraph above describes is one half
of a regulation that reads "VD must be selected so that VC/MC is not greater than
0.8 VD/MD, **or** so that the minimum speed margin between VC/MC and VD/MD is the
greater of ...". ``speeds.vd_basis`` selects which route applies:

    VdBasis.SPEED_RATIO   VD >= 1.25*VC                (the default; unchanged)
    VdBasis.MACH_MARGIN   MD >= MC + margin            (25.335(b)(2); 0.07 default)

On the margin route the 1.25*VC floor does **not** apply -- the two are offered
disjunctively -- and the margin policy comes from :func:`resolve_mach_margin`, the
single owner of that decision. The route is restricted to concept category "C"
(decision D-1, F25-2) so the Appendix-A-oracle-locked FAR 23 path is provably
untouched; FAR 23.335(b)(4) would also permit it for N/U/A, and extending it there
is a separate backlog item.

**What the margin check does NOT cover.** 25.335(b) requires the *greater of* the
(b)(1) upset-criterion speed increase (7.5 deg / 20 s / 1.5 g) and the (b)(2) Mach
margin. Only the Mach term is evaluated here; the upset term is not implemented,
so a clean margin is not by itself a sufficiency demonstration. Every margin-route
output says so. Likewise 25.335(a) requires ``VC >= VB + 1.32*U_ref``: ``vb_kt`` is
accepted and checked for ordering only, because U_ref (25.341(a)(5)(i)) arrives
with F25-1's transport gust pack.
