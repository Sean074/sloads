"""Statistical weight estimation, ported from WTESTIMA.BAS (Hal C. McMaster).

WTESTIMA is the head of the mass-properties pipeline: from a handful of mission
inputs (power, seats, endurance, baggage, pressurization, engine family) it
estimates the take-off, empty and component weights that seed the weight data
base the rest of the suite reads. It is a statistical correlation, not a load
calculation -- see Reference 1 Ch 2 and the User's Guide Tables 3.1/3.2.

The original prints every figure through ``INT(...)`` (truncation toward zero);
that truncation is preserved here so the figures match the manual's printout
exactly. The single-engine "misc other system wt" reads 0 because the BASIC
prints an unset variable on that path -- preserved as a documented quirk.

Reference: WTESTIMA.BAS, Appendix C p374-376; worked example Appendix A p133.
