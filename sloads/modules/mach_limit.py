"""Mach-limit lines for the flight-limits diagram, ported from MACHLIM.BAS.

For high-performance / high-altitude airplanes the cruise and dive speed limits
above the "shoulder" altitude are set by Mach number rather than equivalent
airspeed. MACHLIM tabulates the Mach-limited equivalent airspeeds from the
shoulder altitude up to the maximum operating altitude, for the cruise (MC), dive
(MD) and never-exceed (MNE) Mach lines, to be drawn on the flight-limits diagram
(Reference 1 Ch 6).

Equations (MACHLIM.BAS):
    MNE = 0.9 * MD            never-exceed Mach
    V(M, EAS) = M * a * sqrt(sigma)   at each altitude, with a and sigma from the
                                      shared standard atmosphere

**Flutter clearance is not computed here (#79, C210-19).** MACHLIM.BAS also prints
``MFC = 1.2 * MD`` and its per-altitude ``V(FC)``, and this module reproduced both
until 2026-08-26. They are flutter-substantiation content under 14 CFR 23.629, not
a design load, and the symbol reads to a Part 25 audience as §25.253's VFC/MFC,
which is a different quantity with a different definition. Removed from the tool by
owner directive: a deliberate replication-scope reduction, registered in
``docs/20_theory/02_approved_corrections.md`` -- the printed 0.4836 is not wrong,
it is out of scope. MNE and the V(MC)/V(MNE)/V(MD) lines are unaffected and stay
oracle-locked.

(The original used a = 29.02; the shared ``standard_atmosphere`` uses 29.02436 --
a ~0.01% difference absorbed by the ±0.1% regression tolerance, per Decision 3.)

MC and MD are **not** MACHLIM inputs (F25-2, schema v40): they are produced by
``structural_speeds.design_speed_values`` from VC/VD at the shoulder altitude and
passed to :func:`mach_limit_lines` -- as is the shoulder altitude itself since
schema v55 (#52): ``speeds.shoulder_altitude_ft`` is its one home. Storing them here as well used to let the CLI
and the GUI disagree about the same project's MNE -- the GUI recomputed and
the CLI did not.

Reference: MACHLIM.BAS, Ch 6; worked example Appendix A p160 (MC 0.323, MD 0.403,
shoulder 12000 ft, max 18000 ft: MNE 0.3627; V(MC) 170.16 .. 150.77). The same page
prints MFC 0.4836, which this port deliberately does not produce (above).
