"""Spanwise empennage load distribution -- the tail's structural deliverable.

Design note: ``docs/30_future/09_distributed_empennage_loads_plan.md``, step
**T2**, decisions T-2/T-3/T-6/T-8/T-9/T-10. Planform resolution and the
half/full bookkeeping: :mod:`sloads.tail_geometry`. Conventions:
``docs/10_standard/CONVENTIONS.md``.

The empennage has had *chordwise* loads since C7 (``taildist.py``, Ch 10,
Appendix-A oracle-locked) and *totals* since C6 (``select.py``). What it has
never had is the thing the wing has: a load at every span station, on a stated
load reference axis, that a beam model can be sized from. This module is that,
and it is a pure consumer -- SELECT's ``LT25``/``LT50`` and the v-tail side
loads are **read, never recomputed** (T-7), so no Appendix A figure moves.

The distribution
----------------
Chord-proportional, for both the angle-of-attack (``LT25``) and camber/control
(``LT50``) parts (decision T-2). Per strip ``j`` of the **whole** planform area
``S`` -- the strip quadrature's own ``sum(c_j*dy)`` (``TailPlanform.strip_area``),
so the strips sum to the SELECT total exactly on an entered polyline as well as
on the derived rectangle::

    w25_j = k_side * LT25 * (c_j*dy)/S
    w50_j = k_side * LT50 * (c_j*dy)/S
    fz_j  = w25_j + w50_j                                     air
    tor_j = w25_j*(x_lra_j - x25_j) + w50_j*(x_lra_j - x50_j)  torsion about the LRA
    fi_j  = -n_n * W_surf * (c_j*dy)/S                        inertia (T-9)
    fa_j  = -n_a * W_surf * (c_j*dy)/S                        axial (v-tail only)

Chordwise placement stays exactly TAILDIST's -- ``LT25`` at 25 % chord, ``LT50``
at 50 % -- so the strip torsion about any reference axis is closed-form and the
whole distribution has **analytic** closure targets. That matters more here than
usual: no printed oracle exists for a spanwise tail distribution, so those
closed forms *are* the gate (``CLAUDE.md`` practice 2, plan §4).

Three things that are easy to get backwards, and are not
--------------------------------------------------------
**1. The inertia sign is d'Alembert, full stop** (decision T-9). It is
``-n * W_surf``, set by the case's load factor alone -- never "opposing the air
load". The governing GA6 h-tail conditions are *down*-load cases
(``UNCHECKED MAN DN`` at -1400 lb), so a magnitude-opposing rule would relieve
exactly the cases that size the surface. ``test_the_inertia_sign_is_dalembert``
pins it by asserting a down-load case comes out **larger** in magnitude than
air alone.

**2. The h-tail beam is full span, tip to tip** (decision T-8). Not a semispan
table doubled: the stations run from the port tip through the centreline to the
starboard tip as one member, reacted at the **fuselage attachment stations**
this module defines (``attachment_y``) rather than clamped at a root. That is
the only topology that can carry the 23.427(a) left/right asymmetry in one deck,
and it keeps SELECT's both-sides totals end-to-end with no factor-of-two seam.
The attachment stations are defined *here*, in the physics, and not improvised
by the deck writer -- otherwise the export invariant would have nothing to close
against (plan §7's named risk).

**3. Cumulative quantities run tip->root on each half.** ``sz``/``mxx``/``myy``
at a station are the internal loads there, integrating the loads **outboard of
it on its own half**, exactly as ``airloads.py`` does. The two halves meet at
the centreline. A station's own ``fz``/``fx`` are the applied strip loads, which
is what the deck emits directly -- the wing bridge has to *difference* the
cumulative column because WINGINER publishes nothing else, and that differencing
is what smears a concentrated mass inboard (the filed wing-export defect). The
tail publishes the strip loads, so the export needs no differencing and inherits
none of that.

**4. The surface weight is derived, never entered twice.** It comes from the
``htail``/``vtail``-tagged rows of ``weight.items`` -- the mass SSOT (plan 11
decision B-2) -- through ``mass_distribution.tail_surface_weight``. Until
2026-08-10 this module read ``TailMassInput.panel_weight_lb`` and nothing else,
and **no shipped fixture had ever set one**, so every h-tail deck the suite
produced was air-only while the data base carried the tail mass all along. The
entered value survives as an explicit override; the difference is reported by
``mass_distribution.tail_reconciliation`` either way.

Each surface's inertia, and why they differ
-------------------------------------------
The h-tail's normal axis is the airplane's vertical, so one term does it:
``-n_z*W_ht`` in ``fz``, bending the surface. The **fin's normal axis is
lateral**, so the same vertical acceleration does something else entirely to it,
and the fin needs two terms:

* ``-n_y*W_vt`` in ``fz`` (the local normal, mapped to airplane ``fy``) --
  the bending term, with ``n_y = (LT25+LT50)/W_case`` from
  :func:`lateral_load_factor`. It relieves the surface total by exactly
  ``W_vt/W_case``, which is what makes it self-checking, and it inherits plan 13
  decision **L-7**'s fin-only over-statement caveat.
* ``-n_z*W_vt`` in ``f_span`` -- **axial** along the fin, no bending at all.

This supersedes plan 13 decision **L-8** for this per-condition view (user
decision, 2026-08-10). The balanced case remains the authority for a *balanced*
lateral field; what changed is that the fin's own mass now appears in the fin's
own deck, where before the deck was silently air-only.

The two control-surface load paths (T-4)
----------------------------------------
``"smeared"`` (the default, phase 1): the control load is already in the
distribution above -- ``LT50`` is the camber/elevator part and it is spread with
the rest. Nothing is added or removed; the mode is a statement about what the
numbers mean.

``"discrete"`` (T6): the control surface's own load leaves the strips and enters
the parent surface where the airplane puts it -- hinge reactions by tributary
span, plus the hinge-moment couple at the actuator. The control load is
**SELECT's own** (``elevator_load`` / ``load_on_rudder``, oracle-locked), and the
hinge moment is that load on the centroid of TAILDIST's aft-of-hinge pressure
block: the first hinge-moment output in the suite. See the section header below
for what each of those choices is protecting against.

T-tail transfer (T7)
--------------------
Where the layout says the horizontal tail sits on the fin, every v-tail case also
carries the h-tail's concurrent load at the fin tip -- the balancing load at that
case's own V-n point plus the h-tail's inertia (decision T-5). Conventional
layouts are untouched, to the byte.

    **T-tail first, because it is a different topology, not a different number**
    (note 24 F5.1). A T-tail horizontal surface is not attached to the fuselage at
    all -- it sits on the fin, and every load it carries reaches the airplane
    through the fin tip. Its beam therefore has *one* support on the centreline,
    a rigid joint that reacts moment as well as shear; reporting a pair of
    fuselage-side supports for it would describe a load path the airplane does not
    have. Entered ``tail_type`` is the whole authority, so nothing is assumed.

    **The outline branch interpolates, and does not take the maximum.** The
    horizontal tail attaches to the body at its own station -- in the tail cone --
    so the width that matters is :func:`~sloads.derived_geometry.fuselage_width_at`
    evaluated at the h-tail *root LRA* station, the same axis the beam model puts
    the node on (F6). ``parametric.fuselage_width`` is the **maximum** section and
    is deliberately not used: on ``atr42_100`` it is 106 in against 22 in at the
    tail, which would put the attachments five times too far outboard.

    That branch is marked **assumed even for an entered outline**, and the reason
    is worth stating: a fuselage outline is a station-area table sized to describe
    *volume*, and no shipped one resolves the tail cone at the empennage -- the
    three-section default (:func:`~sloads.models.inputs.default_fuselage_outline`)
    carries a tail-end width of a *tenth* of the maximum, a shape factor nobody
    measured. The attachment half-span swings by half again on that factor alone.
    Consumers that need a station they can build structure on should gate on
    ``basis``, and the real fix is an entered attachment butt line -- the h-tail
    surface's ``sob_y_in`` (BM-1: one quantity, read here and by the wing SOB
    resolver), not a better guess at the body.

    **The fallback is the centreline pair**: still two distinct determinate
    supports, still carrying the 23.427(a) asymmetry, but a single strip wide, so
    the recovered attachment bending is high -- the same direction as the wing's
    centreline-clamp limitation, and filed alongside it.

# What changes in ``"discrete"`` mode is *where the control load enters the

# control surface's own share stops being spread over the parent planform and is
# handed to it the way the airplane hands it over -- normal reactions at the
# hinges, and the hinge-moment couple at the actuator.
#
# Three things this path is careful about:
#
# 1. **The control load is SELECT's** (decision T-12), read and never recomputed:
#    ``elevator_load`` (SELECT.BAS 5216-5218) and its rudder counterpart, split
#    into their camber and angle-of-attack parts so each leaves the distribution
#    from the chord station TAILDIST put it at. Plan 09 T6's own sentence said
#    "the control part (LT50)", and that is not the same thing: ``LT50`` is the
#    *camber* load and its chordwise trapezoid runs leading edge to trailing edge,
#    so hanging all of it on the hinges would move stabilizer load onto the
#    elevator while ignoring the angle-of-attack share the elevator really
#    carries. Where a condition publishes no such value (the balancing, checked,
#    gust and unsymmetrical h-tail conditions; the rudder-neutral fin ones) the
#    load is **derived** from the TAILDIST aft-of-hinge block and marked, the

#
# 2. **The identity is structural, not lucky** (decision T-14). Exactly the
#    control load leaves the strips and exactly the control load arrives at the
#    hinges, because the removal shares are normalised to sum to one over the
#    control surface's span. Removing it with the raw strip fractions would leave
#    the cross-mode force identity resting on ``sum(frac) == 1``, which is exact
#    for a derived rectangle and only 1 %-true for an entered polyline -- the T1
#    validator's own tolerance, quietly become a load error.
#
# 3. **The actuator carries a couple, not a force** (decision T-15). The schema
#    has no horn radius, so a rotary actuator is the honest model -- and it makes
#    the chordwise bookkeeping exact: hinge torsion plus actuator couple is
#    ``L_cs * (x_lra - x_cp)``, the control load acting at its own centre of
#    pressure, which is the number the smeared mode would have produced had it
#    ever placed the load there.

#: Chordwise centroid of the aft-of-hinge pressure block, as a fraction of the
#: aft-of-hinge chord (decision T-13). It is exactly a third because that block is
#: **always** a triangle: TAILDIST's net trailing-edge pressure is identically
#: zero (``WATT3 = WCAM3 = 0``), so the profile aft of the hinge line runs
#: linearly from its hinge-line value to nothing at the trailing edge, whatever
#: the case. That is what makes the suite's first hinge moment a closed form
#: rather than a quadrature.

    Two consequences, both stated in-band on every v-tail result rather than left

    1. It **relieves**. The strip inertia is ``-n_y*W_vt*frac``, so the surface
       total comes out at ``(1 - W_vt/W_case)`` of the air load exactly -- 0.7 %
       on ga6, 1.8 % on the regional jet. Small, and in the unconservative
       direction, which is precisely why it is reported and not buried.
    2. It inherits **plan 13 decision L-7**: no fuselage or wing side force in
       sideslip exists anywhere in this suite, so reacting the fin's load with
       inertia alone over-states the real airplane's ``n_y``. Conservative for
       the accelerations, and it makes the relief above an upper bound on itself.

    Superseding L-8 for this view is deliberate (user decision, 2026-08-10): the

# On a T-tail the horizontal surface is not attached to the fuselage at all: it
# sits on top of the fin, and every load it carries reaches the airplane *through*
# the fin. Until this step ``TailType.T_TAIL`` drove only the three-view sketch --
# a v-tail deck for a T-tail airplane was the same deck it would have been for a
# conventional one, missing the load its own tip is holding up.
#
# What "concurrent" means is decision T-5: the **balancing** h-tail load at the
# v-tail case's own V-n point, plus the h-tail's inertia at that point's load
# factor. Rational pairing, one deck per fin case. The conservative alternative --
# pairing every fin case with the critical h-tail load whatever condition produced
# it -- is pre-scoped in plan §8 as a selectable policy and deliberately not the
# default, because it pairs loads the airplane never sees together.
