"""Balanced free-free airplane cases -- wing tip to wing tip, nose to tail.

Plan 11 (``docs/30_future/11_balanced_airframe_cases_plan.md``) step **B2**,
decisions B-1…B-5. Conventions: ``docs/10_standard/CONVENTIONS.md``.

The goal, in the user's words: *a full airplane balanced case with no need for a
constraint, because the loads balance.* The airplane already balances at trim --
``flight_envelope._balance`` closes ``LZW + LT = Nz*W`` exactly, and
``test_concept_closure`` has asserted it for a long time. What was missing is
that the **distributed** loads never inherited that balance: the wing
distribution, the tail load, the fuselage inertia and the trim solve were four
separate calculations that nothing assembled.

This module assembles them and reports what is left over.

Three things had to be got right, and each was measured rather than assumed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1. A cumulative torsion is not a free moment.** ``WingStationLoad.myy`` is the
torsion about the *root* 25 % chord, and it already contains the sweep and
dihedral transfer of outboard shear inboard (``tyy``/``tvyy`` in
``airloads.py``). Assembling from it *and* applying the strip's position offset
counts the transfer twice: on ``ga6_normal`` PHAA that puts the pitching-moment
residual at **20.5 %** of ``n*W*MAC`` instead of 0.15 %. Only the section
pitching moment ``ml`` is a free moment, and :func:`_free_moments` recovers it by
subtracting the two transfer accumulations back out.

**2. The wing load must be at the balanced case's own flight condition.** The
entered ``wing_mass.cases`` carry a hand-written ``cl``/``v_eas_kt`` that is a
*different condition* from the V-n point SELECT pairs them with -- ``atr42_100``
enters CL 1.55 at 170 kt against its V-n point's 1.7283 at 185.85 kt. Assembling
the two halves then compares different flight conditions, and the force residual
runs 10-37 % of ``n*W``. So the wing distribution is **recomputed at the V-n
point's own** ``cl``/``v``/``nz`` (:func:`wing_sets`). The entered distributions
are untouched and remain the FAR 23 deliverables -- this adds a case, it does not
change one, and no Appendix A oracle moves.

**3. The mass model is the items, not WINGINER's own.** Wing inertia comes from
the ``WING``-tagged items of the case's derived loading (step B1/C1) -- read as
**reacted parts** (:func:`~sloads.mass_distribution.reacted_parts`, design note
29), so a fuel row partly carried by the wing contributes its wing share here and
its body share to :func:`body_inertia` -- spread over WINGINER's spanwise shape --
decision B-2 and plan 11 §4. Taking it from
``wing_mass.panel_weight_lb + concentrated`` instead double-counts anything that
is in both models: on ``atr42_100`` and ``dhc8_dash8`` the wing-tank fuel is, and
the residual runs 12-13 % rather than 1.9 %.

What the assembled case carries, and what it must not
-----------------------------------------------------
The seam rule (plan 11 §4), stated once: **a load that a free-body cut
introduces is never applied in the assembled model.** Each per-component deck
takes a cut and carries the cut reaction as an applied load; in the assembled
model the solver recovers it. Concretely the wing carry-through reaction
(``BodyStationLoad.source == "carry"``) is *excluded* -- :func:`assemble` never
reads ``body_loads``, and :func:`carry_sources_absent` is the guard.

The fuselage pitching moment
----------------------------
The trim carries ``Cm`` for the airplane **less tail** -- wing *and* fuselage --
while the distributed wing carries only its own section ``Cm``. The difference is
the fuselage's Munk moment, and it has no distributed carrier until backlog item
M4-19 lands the Multhopp/Nelson body moment. It is applied here as a single free
moment on the fuselage (``source="fuselage-cm"``), which preserves the total
exactly and is labelled as lumped wherever it is rendered. Omitting it would
leave a moment residual of the same size for the closure to absorb silently -- a
real aero load disguised as a correction.

Its size is **not** a small positive constant. Measured across the fixtures that
have flight cases it runs **-6.6 to +4.9 %** of ``n*W*MAC`` on ``ga6_normal`` and
**-8.5 to +5.8 %** on ``concept_regional_jet``, and it changes sign -- with
``alpha``, as a slope term must (``NMAA`` is the negative-``alpha`` case on the
ga6). An earlier "+4.3 to +6.3 %, positive" reading here was taken over the
symmetric wing conditions only and did not survive the negative-``alpha`` and
lateral points (corrected 2026-08-15).

Residual closure (B-3)
----------------------
Whatever is left is closed as mass-proportional inertia relief in two decoupled
degrees of freedom -- ``delta_n`` on every mass, and a pitch term
``+k*(x_i - x_cg)*w_i``. They do not fight each other: the pitch term sums to
zero force because ``sum(w_i*(x_i - x_cg)) == 0`` by the definition of the CG,
and the ``delta_n`` term sums to zero moment for the same reason. Both magnitudes
are recorded on the result, and the gate is on the residual **before** closure --
the physics, not the correction.

The antisymmetric cases (B7)
----------------------------
**Only ``ACRL`` is antisymmetric, and it is measured, not assumed.** The
handedness of a wing case lives entirely in ``WingLoadCase.unbal_moment`` (UNB,
FAR 23.349), and UNB is non-zero on ``ACRL`` alone -- ``ga6_normal`` -149,043
in-lb, ``concept_regional_jet`` -600,000, zero everywhere else including
``TORS`` on every fixture. That is not a fixture accident: a *steady* roll has no
unbalanced rolling moment by definition (the aileron moment is balanced by roll
damping), and the up-going/down-going aero asymmetry that remains has no
spanwise representation anywhere in this suite. ``TORS`` is therefore assembled
as the symmetric case it is, and :func:`test_only_acrl_carries_roll` pins that
finding so a fixture that ever enters a non-zero UNB for it goes red.

**The applied couple is lumped; the reaction is distributed.** WINGINER's model
-- the one Appendix A is locked to -- never distributes the aileron's own lift
increment: it takes only the *inertia reaction* to the roll acceleration UNB
causes (``fz_r``, the unit-roll distribution). The assembled case matches that
exactly: the aero rolling moment enters as a single labelled free couple at the
wing aerodynamic centre (``source="aileron-roll"``, the same treatment and the
same honesty as ``fuselage-cm``), and the distributed antisymmetric load the
wing actually carries comes out of the **roll degree of freedom of the closure**.
The consequence is stated wherever the case is rendered: the aileron's spanwise
lift increment is not modelled, because ``AileronLoadsInput`` carries areas and
no butt lines (filed in the backlog).

**And that closure is checkable against an independent producer.** Closing the
roll residual with ``k_roll*w_i*y_i`` -- physically ``-m_i*p_dot*y_i``, the roll
analog of the pitch term, decoupled from all three symmetric DOF because
``sum(w_i*y_i) == 0`` for a mirror-symmetric mass model -- reproduces WINGINER's
``ur*fz_r`` distribution **strip for strip**: ratio 1.000000 on both fixtures,
with the wing-item/panel scale cancelling identically. Two producers, one answer:
WINGINER's oracle-locked recurrence and this module's ``p_dot`` solve. That
identity is the B7 closure gate (``test_roll_closure_reproduces_winginer``),
standing in for the printed oracle concept mode does not have.

The lateral cases (B8a)
-----------------------
Plan 13 (``docs/40_history/18_b8a_lateral_closure_plan.md``), decisions L-1…L-8.
SELECT's four rational v-tail conditions -- sudden rudder, yaw to sideslip, yaw
15 neutral, side gust -- assemble as balanced cases too, and they are the first
lateral load factors this suite has ever produced. All four sit on V-n points at
``n_z ~ 1``, so the vertical/longitudinal/pitch half is the symmetric machinery
unchanged; what is added is the fin's distributed side load (:func:`vtail_sets`)
and the three lateral degrees of freedom of the closure B8a-2 built.

**Nothing balances a rudder kick, and nothing is supposed to.** In the symmetric
case aero and inertia nearly cancel and a residual over 1 % means something is
missing. Laterally there is nothing to cancel against: the pre-closure ``Fy`` and
``Mz`` residuals **are** the fin load, in full, by construction. So
:data:`RESIDUAL_GATE` does not apply to them -- the same standing as ``ACRL``'s
roll residual -- and the gate that does is that the case's *symmetric half*, with
the fin load removed, still closes inside 1 %.

**The fin is the only lateral aero the suite computes** (decision L-7). Fuselage
and wing side force in sideslip exist on the airplane and nowhere in these 22
programs, and the two degrees of freedom they are missing from err in **opposite
directions**. The body's yawing couple is destabilizing and opposes the fin's, so
the yaw acceleration is **over-stated** and the inertia it drives is
conservative. The body-and-wing side force, however, acts the *same* way as the
fin's restoring load at ``+beta`` -- it **adds** -- so ``n_y`` is
**under-stated** and the lateral translational inertia it drives is **not**
conservative. Neither is the airplane's real acceleration. That is said in-band,
on every lateral case, through :data:`LATERAL_AERO_NOTE`. Both magnitudes are
stated as *unknown*, because quantifying them is building the missing model
(backlog L-7); this is the weaker of the suite's two honesty statements and is
not dressed up as the stronger one (the lumped fuselage ``Cm``, whose size can be
quoted).

The unsymmetrical horizontal tail (D-R8)
---------------------------------------
Decision **D-R8** (2026-08-10), review finding **F-R5**. FAR **23.427(a)** is the
one horizontal-tail condition with a genuine hand: SELECT takes the
largest-magnitude symmetric tail load and puts 100 % of half of it on one side
and ``pc = min(100 - 10(n-1), 80)`` percent on the other. Every other h-tail
condition is symmetric and already rides the wing cases as the trim tail load
``vn.lt``; this one has left/right content that a lumped centreline force cannot
carry, and the full-span tail topology (plan 09 decision T-8) was built for it.

**The applied tail load is SELECT's own, and it replaces the trim load** rather
than adding to it: ``RH + LH`` *is* the condition's total tail load, and applying
``vn.lt`` beside it would count the balancing part twice. The h-tail strips come
from :func:`htail_sets`, the exact analogue of :func:`vtail_sets` -- air only, with
the surface's mass left in :func:`body_inertia` to ride the closure field, so
each mass still enters exactly one set.

**The pre-closure residual is the maneuver, not an error.** The 23.427(a) load is
a *maneuver* load (the unchecked maneuver governs on both fixtures that assemble)
and its V-n point is a balanced one at ``n_z ~ 1``, so the airplane is genuinely
not in trim: on ``ga6_normal`` the applied tail load is -1204.7 lb against a trim
-177.7, and the difference -- 49.8 % of ``n*W``, 144 % of ``n*W*MAC`` -- comes out
as ``delta_n = -0.496 g`` and ``q_dot = +637 deg/s^2``. That is what an abrupt
elevator input does, and closing it in the pitch degree of freedom is the
standard treatment of an unbalanced pitching maneuver, not a correction applied
to a broken balance. :data:`RESIDUAL_GATE` therefore does not apply to this
family's ``Fz``/``My`` either -- the same standing as the lateral cases -- and the
gate that does is that the case's **trim half**, with the 23.427(a) set replaced
by the lumped ``vn.lt``, still closes inside it
(``test_the_trim_half_of_an_unsymmetrical_case_still_closes``).

Two independent producers check what is applied: the set's per-side sums are
SELECT's own ``RH``/``LH`` to the last digit, and its rolling moment about the
centreline is the closed form ``(RH - LH) * y_bar`` with ``y_bar`` the
chord-weighted centroid of the half planform -- ratio 1.000000000 on both
fixtures.

**The twins come from reflection, not recomputation** (decisions B-6/B-7). Every
case with antisymmetric content is emitted as a handed pair, the port case being
the mirror image of the starboard one through
:func:`sloads.export.coordinates.reflect_load`. The FAR 23 core never sees
handedness; the id gains an ``L``/``R`` suffix and the unhanded id remains the
physical condition.

#: Quantity hint on the **pre-closure residual** force and moment: a statement
#: about how well the case closed, not a load the airframe carries (review
#: 2026-09-04 R-8, #170). The closed case is what it carries; these are what was
#: left over before the residual was distributed, so 14 CFR 23.303's factor states
#: a design quantity where there is none. Vocabulary owner:
#: :data:`sloads.units.NON_LOAD_QUANTITIES`.
CLOSURE_DIAGNOSTIC = "diagnostic"

#: Wing conditions whose load set is symmetric about the centreline. ``TORS``
#: joined this list at B7 **by measurement**: its ``unbal_moment`` is zero on
#: every fixture, because a steady roll has no unbalanced rolling moment (see the
#: module docstring). Assembling it as symmetric is therefore not an
#: approximation -- it is what the case contains.
SYMMETRIC_WING_CONDITIONS = ("PHAA", "PLAA", "PMAA", "NMAA", "TORS")

#: Wing conditions that may carry an unbalanced rolling moment, hence a handed
#: pair. Membership here does **not** by itself make a case antisymmetric: a

#: unhanded, so the twins never appear for a case that has no hand.
ROLLING_WING_CONDITIONS = ("ACRL",)

#: Every wing condition the assembled deck covers.
BALANCED_WING_CONDITIONS = SYMMETRIC_WING_CONDITIONS + ROLLING_WING_CONDITIONS

#: SELECT's four rational vertical-tail conditions (FAR 23.441 maneuver, 23.443
#: gust), each assembled as a **lateral** balanced case at B8a-3. All four sit on
#: V-n points at ``n_z ~ 1``, so the vertical/longitudinal/pitch half of the case
#: is the shipped symmetric machinery unchanged and only the applied set grows.
#: ONENGOUT's 23.367 conditions are deliberately absent: that is a transient, not
#: a balanced steady case (plan 13 §4).
BALANCED_VTAIL_CONDITIONS = ("SUDDEN RUDDER", "YAW TO SIDESLIP",
                             "YAW 15 NEUTRAL", "SIDE GUST")

#: The horizontal-tail conditions assembled as balanced cases (D-R8) -- the
#: 23.427(a) unsymmetrical load and nothing else, because it is the only h-tail
#: condition with a hand. The symmetric ones are *already* in the deliverable, as
#: the trim tail load ``vn.lt`` of every wing case's balanced assembly; giving
#: them a second assembled case would put the same physics in the deck twice
#: under a different name (:data:`SKIP_REASONS` ``htail-symmetric`` says so on
#: the record rather than dropping them silently).
BALANCED_HTAIL_CONDITIONS = ("UNSYMMETRICAL",)

#: Acceptance gate (plan 11 §6): the residual **before** closure, as a fraction
#: of ``n*W`` for force and ``n*W*MAC`` for moment.
#:
#: **It does not apply laterally, and that is physics rather than an exemption**
#: (plan 13 §2). A symmetric case's aero and inertia nearly cancel, so a residual
#: above 1 % means something is missing. A rudder kick has *nothing to cancel
#: against*: the fin load is reacted by inertia alone, so the pre-closure lateral
#: residual **is** the whole fin load by construction -- the same standing as
#: ``ACRL``'s roll residual, which plan 11 §10 already records. The lateral gate
#: is instead that the case's **symmetric half** still closes inside this bound
#: with the fin load removed (``test_the_symmetric_half_still_closes``).
RESIDUAL_GATE = 0.01

#: The **force** half of the acceptance, as a fraction of ``n*W`` (owner's
#: decision, 2026-08-22, closing CR-C-2).
#:
#: Plan 11 stated one flat 1 % for both components, and the pitch residual meets
#: it everywhere with an order of magnitude to spare (0.014-0.086 %). Force does
#: not: the four type fixtures reach 1.209-2.360 %, an ordering that tracks
#: **fixture lift-model quality** rather than the assembly -- ``ga6_normal``, the
#: one fixture whose aero and planform come from a printed source, is best at
#: 0.624 %, and the concept configurations are worst. Every case still closes
#: exactly after correction, and the DOF that would expose a mis-placed force --
#: pitch -- stays at a tenth of its own gate.
#:
#: None of these six is a printed oracle: the balanced full-span model is a
#: mission-extension deliverable with no Appendix A/B figure behind it (the
#: FAR23 replication core is oracle-locked separately and is untouched by this
#: number). So the acceptance is set where the suite already enforced it -- this
#: was ``tests/test_balance.py``'s hard stop, the level at which "a small
#: correction to a balance that nearly held" stops being a fair description --
#: and the controlling document now judges force against the same value the
#: tests do, instead of reporting a failure against an acceptance nothing
#: enforced. The per-fixture, per-family ``_FORCE_RESIDUAL_RATCHET`` in that test
#: is unchanged and remains the regression guard: a fixture drifting from
#: 2.360 % toward this bound still fails loudly, well before it arrives.
FORCE_RESIDUAL_ACCEPTANCE = 0.025

#: Applied lateral content below this fraction of ``n*W`` is summation noise, not
#: a hand (decision L-6). It serves the rolling test of :func:`is_handed` too,
#: against ``n*W*(b/2)``: the margin there is fifteen orders of magnitude -- a
#: mirror-symmetric applied set nets 1e-17 of ``n*W*b/2`` in roll, and the
#: 23.427(a) h-tail case 6e-3 to 1.7e-2 -- so one threshold serves both.
HANDEDNESS_TOL = 1e-9

#: The B7 statement of record for the lumped aileron couple, carried in-band on
#: every ``ACRL`` case (the case's ``notes``, hence the deck header and the UI)
#: and in the report's standing limitations (review F-R4) — one wording for both,
#: because the deck and the controlling document must not caveat the same
#: modelling choice differently. The couple's *magnitude* is per case and is
#: stated beside this sentence; what is standing is the modelling choice.

#: until then: the wing-body side force and yawing moment in sideslip are now
#: computed (DATCOM 5.2.1.1 / 5.2.3.1, :mod:`sloads.lateral_body_aero`) and
#: applied when ``aero_coeffs.lateral_body_aero.enabled`` -- **off by default**
#: (decision L-7.3), because the term raises the load on one lateral degree of
#: freedom and lowers it on the other. So the standing statement says what the
#: term is and which way each degree of freedom errs when it is NOT applied,
#: and every lateral case adds one of two per-case sentences (decision L-7.16):
#: :func:`lateral_aero_case_note` -- the *estimated* effect on this case when
#: the term is off, or the applied numbers and the net static-stability check
#: when it is on. The *direction* is stated per degree of freedom because the

#: and OPPOSES the fin's, so ``psi_dd`` is over-stated without it and its

    """The airplane's **non-wing** drag: ``(applied, dCD, clamped, loads, notes)``.

    Design note: ``docs/40_history/24_body_drag_carrier_note.md``.

    The FLTLOADS trim balances the airplane-less-tail drag from the **polar**
    (``aero_curves.drag_cd``, the ``CD(CL)`` polynomial the project enters);
    the assembled model's only ``fx`` is the wing strips' own chordwise force
    (``airloads``: section profile drag plus the lifting-line induced drag,
    resolved with lift through the case ``alpha``). The difference is the
    fuselage, the nacelles and every other non-wing parasite contribution, and
    before this it was simply absent -- ``residual_fx`` *equalled* the wing
    strips' sum, and the couple the missing force left about the CG was the
    whole of the pre-closure pitch residual.

    That it is genuinely parasite drag, and not a bookkeeping artefact, is
    measurable: both the trim and the strips resolve through the same ``alpha``,
    so the body-axis gap splits exactly into wind-axis parts,

        dD = dFx*cos(a) + dFz*sin(a)        dL = dFz*cos(a) - dFx*sin(a)

    and ``dL/L`` comes out <= 0.6 % everywhere while ``dD/(q*S)`` is a near
    constant **-0.018 across all seven** ``ga6_normal`` cases -- a ``CD`` offset
    independent of ``CL``, which is what a missing parasite term looks like and
    what a lift-model disagreement does not.

    ``dCD`` is returned as that **wind-axis** increment rather than the axial one
    (the two differ by the negligible ``dL*sin(a)`` tilt), because the physical
    content of the diagnostic is the drag-coefficient offset.

    **Sign.** ``CONVENTIONS.md`` §1: ``x`` is +aft, so both ``vn.dx`` and the
    strips' ``fx`` are already body-axis ``x`` forces and the correction is a
    subtraction in one frame, needing no rotation. Positive is aft, i.e. drag.

    **A forward value is a defect in one of the two drag models, not a load**
    (D-4 as revised 2026-08-17, backlog Pri 2). Where it appears is what
    decides the treatment, and the deciding quantity is the trim's ``alpha``
    against the polar's trusted window :data:`~sloads.constants.POLAR_TRUSTED_ALPHA_DEG`
    (:func:`polar_alpha_trusted`):

    * **outside the window** the polar is being read where it was never fitted
      -- above it the strip model's induced drag overshoots
      (``concept_regional_jet``, +20/+22 deg), below it the fit is 13 deg under
      zero lift (``NMAA`` on the three crudest-polar fixtures) -- so a forward
      difference is **not applied**: no ``body-axial`` card, ``body_axial`` = 0,
      ``body_axial_clamped`` set, and the raw value in the note. ``dCD`` is
      still computed and reported from the unclamped difference, so the G10
      diagnostic keeps its signal; ``residual_fx`` re-opens by exactly the
      clamped amount on those cases and only those, and the G1/G5 gates read
      the same flag. Revision 1 of D-4 refused to clamp because that would
      "reopen ``residual_fx`` and hide the overshoot"; it hid neither once the
      window is stated and ``dCD`` stays reported, and it put a forward
      "drag" of 1.0-1.4 klb on three ``NMAA`` decks (backlog Pri 2).
    * **inside the window** both models are trusted, so a forward value cannot
      be excused: it is applied as computed **and** noted, and
      ``tests/test_balance.py``'s G10 gate fails on it -- the fixture's aero
      data is wrong, not the assembly.

    **Placement.** The waterline is the single owner
    :func:`~sloads.derived_geometry.body_drag_waterline` and is the only free
    parameter here (decision D-1). The fuselage station reaches no gate -- a pure
    axial force contributes ``my = (z-zcg)*fx`` with no ``x`` term -- so it is
    spread over the body outline by cross-section-area share where one exists,
    and lumped at the body masses' own centroid where it does not. Both are
    stated; neither can move a number.

    """The user-entered engine thrust: one hub force per engine, ``(loads, notes)``.

    Carved out of design note 21 (``docs/30_future/21_power_effects_wing_note.md``),
    whose seven-step wake plan stays parked. What ships here is the one piece
    that needs no estimator: the user enters ``EngineInput.thrust_lb`` and it
    becomes a ``FORCE`` at that engine's hub -- the node the LRA skeleton has
    carried since R-9 and has never had a load on
    (:mod:`sloads.export.lra_model`).

    **Sign and station.** ``CONVENTIONS.md`` §1: ``x`` is +aft, so thrust is
    ``fx = -T``. It acts at ``prop_cg`` -- ``XPROP/YPROP/ZPROP``, the hub -- and
    falls back to ``engine_cg`` only when no hub is entered; thrust with neither
    raises rather than being placed on a guess, the refusal rule the LRA
    exporter already follows for its missing datums.

    **The thrust line is axial.** The P-6 incidence/toe angles (``i_T``, ``tau``)
    have no fields and no estimator, and inventing them would put a lateral and
    a vertical component into every case on an assumed geometry. So this is a
    pure ``-x`` force, said in-band, and note 21 keeps the rest.

    **Nothing balances it, and that is the point.** The V-n trim this case is
    assembled at is thrust-free -- ``fltloads`` balances the airplane's drag from
    the polar and knows nothing about power -- so the applied thrust is a genuine
    unbalance in two degrees of freedom: ``Fx`` in full, and its couple
    ``-T*(z_hub - z_cg)`` in pitch. Both are reacted by the closure, which is
    exactly where they belong:

        ``n_x = (D - sum T) / W``

    -- the suite's ``x`` being +aft, so a thrust that exactly cancels the drag
    gives ``n_x = 0`` and thrust in excess of it gives a forward (negative)
    ``n_x``. That is FAR 23's longitudinal load factor, and the carrier this module's
    docstring records the suite as lacking (**"the suite has no distributed
    thrust"**, :func:`_closure`). ``q_dot`` reacts the couple. A powered case is
    therefore *not* in longitudinal or pitch trim by construction, and
    :data:`RESIDUAL_GATE` does not apply to its ``My`` -- the same standing as
    the 23.427(a) maneuver tail load and the lateral families' ``Fy``/``Mz``.
    The gate that does apply is the six-DOF closure itself, and the closed form
    :func:`hub_thrust` states: a constructed case whose thrust equals its drag
    closes at ``n_x = 0``.

    **Flight only.** A ground case gets no thrust: rating it per family is note
    21's parked ``power_policy`` table, and a landing case has no thrust rating
    here to give. :func:`assemble_ground` says so in-band rather than dropping
    the input in silence.

    ``thrust_lb`` of ``None`` or ``0`` applies nothing at all, which is every
    shipped fixture: today's cases are exactly zero-thrust and stay bit-for-bit
    identical (``test_hub_thrust.py`` G-1).

    The frame change goes through the single owner in

    is ``fz``; and its torsion is about the ``y`` axis, so it is a free ``my``,
    the stored value unchanged. The strips carry the tail's waterline in ``z``,
    which is where they are, not the trim load's reference plane.

    **Air only**, exactly as the fin set is: the surface's mass items stay in
    :func:`body_inertia` and are accelerated by the closure field, so the tail's

    same silent-symmetry failure plan 11 §10 records for ``TORS``, arrived at
    from the opposite direction.

    **It is evaluated pre-closure, so it cannot feed on its own output.** From
    B8a-2 the closure gives any rolling case a lateral relief field, so a
    predicate reading the *final* load set would find lateral content in every
    case that rolls and hand every one of them.

    inertia tensor about that same centroid: the field
    an angular acceleration applies produces the moment ``-[I]{omega_dot}``
    exactly, and ``[I]``'s off-diagonal ``Ixz`` is 8.4 % of the ga6's pitch
    inertia and larger on the regional jet (plan 13 §3.5), so roll and yaw are
    genuinely coupled and three independent ratios would be wrong rather than
    approximate.

    What changed at B8a-2, and what it moved
    ----------------------------------------
    Each acceleration now applies **both** its force components rather than the
    one the vertical-only ancestors carried. That is the difference between
    ``Sum w*d^2`` and a moment of inertia, and it is not uniformly small:

    * pitch gained ``fx = -w*q_dot*dz``. The companion itself is negligible
      (<= 0.08 % of a node load) but the *acceleration* moved, because the pitch
      inertia stopped being ``Sum w*dx^2``: ``q_dot`` fell 18-22 % on
      ``ga6_normal``, 3-4 % on the regional jet;
    * roll gained ``fy = +w*p_dot*dz``, worth 94-518 lb at a peak node -- larger
      than the roll term already in the deck, because ``fz = -w*p_dot*dy``
      touches only the wing strips (every database item sits at ``y = 0``) while
      the companion touches every mass off the roll axis. ``p_dot`` fell 20.7 %
      / 23.2 % accordingly, and the B7 gate reads the *shape* it preserves
      exactly plus that ratio, pinned;
    * yaw is new, and would have been 55 % wrong had it copied the pitch DOF's
      one-component pattern.

    Self-inertia (L-3) rides along as a **free moment** ``-[I_self]{omega_dot}``
    at each node whose mass the assembly carries as a point. It is 13.3 % of
    ``ga6_normal``'s ``Izz``; the regional jet's database enters none.

    The x degree of freedom is not optional: **nothing else in the assembled
    model reacts drag.** The suite has no distributed thrust, and FAR 23's
    longitudinal load factor ``nx`` is exactly this quantity. On ``ga6_normal``
    PHAA the closure gives 0.661 g against the trim's own drag of 0.610. Leaving
    it open would put 17-26 % of ``n*W`` into the support reaction and make
    "reactions ~ 0" untrue in a file that still solved.

    That 0.05 g difference is **not** quadrature (an earlier reading here called
    it "the same strip-quadrature-versus-closed-form gap"; corrected 2026-08-15).
    ``residual_fx`` equals the wing strips' ``Sum fx`` exactly -- nothing in the
    assembled model carries the airplane's **non-wing** drag -- and the gap is
    element-independent: -191.5 lb at 5 elements, -173.4 lb converged at 640. It
    is a missing load, not an integration error, and the same missing load is the
    whole of the pitch residual through its ``(zw - zcg)`` arm. Filed on the
    backlog as "non-wing drag has no carrier in the assembled model".

    The relief is spread over **the inertia loads already in the model**, not
    over the raw item list. Those are the same masses, but at the places the
    assembled model actually carries them -- wing mass out along the span rather
    than on the centreline where the database enters it -- so the deck's internal
    load path stays physical and no relief lands on a node the airplane has no
    mass at.
