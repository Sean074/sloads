"""Physical constants, FAR-mandated numbers and every suite-internal unit factor.

**The one owner** (CONVENTIONS.md §7, review 2026-08-17 constants-and-conversions):
physical constants (``G``, ``RHO_SL``, the atmosphere), FAR-mandated numbers
(``ULTIMATE_FACTOR``, the 23.341 gust constants, the 23.371 gyro rates) and every
**Imperial<->Imperial** factor (``IN_PER_FT``, ``IN2_PER_FT2``, ``DEG_PER_RAD``,
``KT_TO_FPS``, ``FT_LB_S_PER_HP``) live here and nowhere else; the Imperial<->SI
boundary lives in :mod:`sloads.units` (which imports this module, never the
reverse). ``tests/test_constants.py`` grep-guards both directions.

**Value policy: exact by default.** Where a ``.BAS`` program truncated a value
(3.1416, 57.3, 32.2, 295, 1.15*88/60) the exact value is used; a truncated value
survives only as a named ``*_SUITE`` twin beside its exact owner, with the printed
oracle that requires it cited (register: ``docs/20_theory/02_approved_corrections.md``).
The manual's figures are tolerance oracles (+-0.1 %), which every such move was
measured against before it was made.
