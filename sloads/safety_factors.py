"""The **governing safety-factor table** — the one authority for every case's factor.

Decision **G-11** (`docs/40_history/23_step10_ground_cases_plan.md`), the re-shaped
form of backlog item **M4-8**. Before this module the factor was decided ad hoc:
``ConditionResult.safety_factor`` defaulted to ``constants.ULTIMATE_FACTOR`` and
exactly one producer (:mod:`sloads.modules.one_engine_out`) overrode it, with two
silent ``getattr(item, "safety_factor", ULTIMATE_FACTOR)`` fallbacks in
``report/content.py`` reading 1.5 for a factorless case and leaving no trace.

**What the table is.** One row per **load class / condition family**, not per case
(CLAUDE.md practice 3: a cross-cutting convention gets a single-source code owner
plus a drift-guard test). Each row states its factor, its regulatory **basis**, and
its :class:`RowStatus` — derived, overridden or defaulted. A case maps to a family
through :func:`classify`, so **no case can be forgotten by omitting a row**: every
per-case factor, including the report case index's ``SF`` column and the ``SF=``
marker on a bulk-data deck, is a derived view of one of these rows.

**Where the family boundaries come from.** Not invented here — they are 14 CFR
Subpart C's own section groupings (Flight Loads, Control Surface and System Loads,
Ground Loads, ...), so the table's granularity is the regulation's granularity.
Parts 23 and 25 number Subpart C in parallel, so one range table serves both; the
part is carried in the row's basis text, not in the range.

**Why an override cannot move an oracle.** The factor is applied only at the
render/export boundary — the calc stays LIMIT — so no row of this table, however
edited, can shift an Appendix-A figure. What it *can* move is the deliverable, and
that is why an override is never silent: see :class:`GoverningTable` and the four
mitigations recorded with G-11.

Sources: ``reference/14CFR_factor_of_safety.md`` (§ 25.303 / historically § 23.303
— "a factor of safety of 1.5 must be applied to the prescribed limit load");
``reference/ug.txt`` for the Subpart C section text quoted in the row bases.
