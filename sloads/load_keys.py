"""Canonical :class:`~sloads.models.LoadValue` keys for the load-case schema (M4-9).

Every ``LoadValue`` carries a stable ``key``; this module names only the handful
that **cross a module boundary** — the components of the flat load-case row that
``report.load_cases_to_rows`` builds and the sbeam bridge exports. Producers
(``modules/engine.py`` today) and consumers (``report``, the views, the tests)
import the same constant, so a rename is a one-line change that the type checker
and the test suite both follow.

Keys that never leave their own module are named inline at the producing site;
they still must be unique within their ``ConditionResult``
(``test_load_keys.py`` asserts that across every example project).

Why this exists: before M4-9 these were display-label string literals duplicated
in ``report.py``, the views and ~150 test call sites, and a cosmetic relabel
silently blanked the CSV column rather than raising.
