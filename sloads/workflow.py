"""The loads workflow as ordered, dependency-aware steps.

This is the single source of truth for *what the suite does and in what order*:
each :class:`WorkflowStep` names the calc module behind it (``module``), the
project slice(s) it needs (``requires``) and the slice it produces (``produces``),
grouped into the workflow sections the GUI presents. Since Step G2 (Phase G) the
sections follow the FAR 23 analysis flow: **Develop V-n diagram → Flight loads →
Other loads → Landing loads** (see ``docs/30_future/03_gui_rework_plan.md`` §4;
this supersedes the Phase-D Start/Airplane/Envelopes/Analysis grouping in
``05_phase_d_gui_workflow_plan.md``).

**This is the analysis, not the page list** (note 57, D-57.1). Two of the steps
here -- ``tail_span_loads`` and ``balanced_cases`` -- run a registered calc
module and carry no page at all: their deliverables are the report's tail-span
appendix and the balanced deck, and the front-end that gave them a form retired
at #270. The GUI's page set is :func:`gui_pages`, which is these steps filtered
by :func:`oracle_steps` plus the stated :data:`NON_STEP_PAGES`.

It is pure metadata plus pure predicates over a :class:`~sloads.models.Project`
(no Streamlit, no I/O), so the GUI navigation, the Home dashboard's completeness
panel, and any future dependency-ordered "run pipeline" can all be driven from
one place instead of drifting apart. ``requires``/``produces`` are the seed of a
real dependency DAG (see the backlog's Option-C pipeline engine).

``produces`` accepts a dotted path (e.g. ``"weight.envelope"``) so a step whose
real output is a sub-field of a slice can still report completeness precisely.

    reached as a step. #270 made the category a declaration instead of three
    hand-appended blocks in ``Oracle.py``: with one front-end left, the page set
    is *the* page set, and gate G2's "derived, not listed" has to cover all of
    it. Derived stays derived -- adding a ``bas`` to a step still adds a page
    with no edit here -- and what is listed is only the set that is not derivable
    from the analysis at all, each row saying why.
