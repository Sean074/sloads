"""Structured load-case ID allocation (Step D1; unified at M4-2).

Exactly six component prefixes -- control surfaces fold into their host
structural component, per the D-1 taxonomy decision:

======================  ========  ============================================
Component               Prefix    Hosts
======================  ========  ============================================
wing                    ``W``     SELECT + WINGINER/NETLOADS, AILERON, FLAPLOAD, wing tab
htail                   ``HT``    SELECT rational h-tail loads, htail tab
vtail                   ``VT``    SELECT rational v-tail loads, ONENGOUT, vtail tab
fuselage                ``F``     SELECT critical fuselage conditions
engine_mount            ``EM``    ENGLOADS
landing_gear            ``LG``    LANDLOAD
======================  ========  ============================================

IDs are ``f"{prefix}-{seq:02d}"``. **One ID per physical condition** (M4-2
decision 1): where two modules deliver the same condition -- SELECT names the
governing wing point, WINGINER/NETLOADS distribute it spanwise -- they carry the
*same* ``CaseRef``, minted once, so ``report.tables.case_index_rows_from``'s
dedupe-by-``case_id`` collapses them to one row as it was written to.

Wing sequence: fixed slots, not positions (M4-2 decision 4)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The wing ``seq`` is a property of the *condition*, taken from
:data:`WING_SLOTS` -- ``select_wing``'s own fixed pick order. A wing case is
``W-01`` because it is PHAA, not because it happened to be first in a list, so a
changed envelope (one pick missing, a different order in
``WingMassInput.cases``) leaves a gap instead of renumbering every other case.
Persisted ``selected_case_ids`` and previously exported decks reference these
strings, which is why they may not float.

Bands
-----
Modules that mint from their own allocator are **banded** into disjoint numeric
ranges wide enough that no realistic case count collides -- two independent
counters starting at 1 would otherwise produce the same ID for two different
physical cases (an outright collision, not merely a divergent sequence):

* ``W-01``..``W-19`` -- the fixed :data:`WING_SLOTS` conditions (SELECT and the
  WINGINER/NETLOADS results derived from them: the same case, the same ID)
* ``W-20``..``W-39`` -- :data:`WING_BAND_EXTRA`: a hand-authored
  ``WingMassInput.cases`` entry with no ``WING_SLOTS`` name (a concept-mode
  extra condition SELECT does not emit)
* ``W-50``..``W-59`` -- AILERON
* ``W-60``..``W-69`` -- FLAPLOAD
* ``W-70``+          -- a wing-hosted tab (TABLOADS)
* ``HT-01``..        -- SELECT's rational h-tail conditions
* ``HT-50``+         -- a horizontal-tail-hosted tab
* ``VT-01``..        -- SELECT's rational v-tail conditions
* ``VT-30``..``VT-49`` -- :data:`VTAIL_BAND_ONENGOUT`: ONENGOUT (23.367). Its
  dynamic one-engine-out case is **not** one of SELECT's picks, so it is a
  different case object with its own ID -- banded rather than sharing SELECT's
  counter, which would need cross-module allocator state and make IDs depend on
  module run order (M4-2 decision 5).
* ``VT-50``+         -- a vertical-tail-hosted tab

``tests/test_case_ids.py`` is the drift guard: it asserts every minted ID across
a full run is unique, so a new minter that forgets its band fails there rather
than in a deck.

Deck subcase numbering (M4-2 decision 8)
----------------------------------------
:func:`subcase_id` maps a case ID to the integer a solver deck uses for its
``SUBCASE`` and its load-set ``SID``. It is a pure function of the case ID, so a
filtered export (``filter_by_selected_case_ids``) cannot renumber the subcases
that survive, and the component blocks keep wing/tail/body subcases distinct in
an assembled multi-component deck.

The full-span balanced deck mints through :func:`balanced_subcase_id`, which is
the same map moved into its own per-hand block (decision **D-R7**, 2026-08-10):
that deck is the only family carrying handed twins, and an integer subcase id
has nowhere to put the ``L``/``R`` suffix.

Because there are two minters, one case can hold **two** deck numbers -- ``W-05``
is ``105`` in the wing component deck and ``5105`` in the assembled one.
:func:`deck_load_id` is the single owner of that choice for every deliverable
(report, case index, GUI), and :func:`case_label` the single formatter that
states id + ``LABEL`` + ``LOAD``/``SUBCASE`` together
(``docs/40_history/22_case_load_id_linkage_note.md``).

    directions under ids of their own: ``LG-19`` is the port case and ``LG-20``
    the starboard, with no suffix on either, because minting ``LG-19L``/``LG-19R``
    beside a shipped ``LG-20`` would put two ids on one physical condition (M4-2

    the set moved the id of every case after it, and a solver result labelled
    ``SUBCASE 5007`` meant nothing without the run that produced it. Minted here
    instead, from the case's own :class:`~sloads.models.CaseRef` id, the number
    survives any edit to the case set and traces back by eye.

    Handedness is a **block**, not a suffix on the number, because a ``SUBCASE``
    id is an integer: the port twin of ``W-05`` cannot be ``7105L``. The
    unhanded id still names the physical condition, so the two twins of one
