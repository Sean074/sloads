"""The landing gear as a **free body**: contact patch in, reference point out.

Decision **G-12** (``docs/25_notes/23_step10_ground_cases_plan.md``), step 10
piece 3. Conventions: ``docs/10_standard/CONVENTIONS.md``. The reactions
themselves are :mod:`sloads.modules.landing`'s, unchanged and oracle-locked to
Appendix A p230/p236 -- nothing here recomputes one.

One load, delivered twice, for two different readers
----------------------------------------------------
A ground reaction has two consumers who need it in different frames, at different
points, and neither is served well by the other's form:

* the **airframe** wants it at the gear attachment node, in airplane axes, so it
  can be applied to a beam model -- :mod:`sloads.modules.balance` assembles the
  ground cases from exactly that;
* the **gear** wants it at the tyre contact patch, in the ground-line frame, with
  the strut state and ground angle it was computed at -- that is the boundary
  condition a gear analysis starts from, and no previous sloads deliverable
  stated it.

This module owns both, and owns the relationship between them, so the two
artifacts are provably one load seen from two sides rather than two calculations
that happen to agree. The relationship is the deliverable's own drift guard:

    the gear report's reference-point reaction
        == the assembled deck's applied load at the gear node, sign-flipped

which promotes the plan-07 resultant invariant from a hidden test into something
a reader can check by eye.

What it is, and what it is not
------------------------------
This is the **gear interface load definition**. sloads has no gear kinematic
model, so it does not and must not claim drag-brace, side-brace, trunnion or
axle-bending loads. With the contact patch, the components, the ground angle, the
stroke and the reference-point reaction, a gear engineer builds those; without
this artifact they cannot. Overstating it would be the "a wrong card outranks a
missing card" failure in its purest form.

**The leg inertia has a stated limit.** :attr:`GearLegLoad.inertia_fz` is the
leg's own weight at the case's *airplane* vertical load factor, which is what
closes the free body. It is **not** a gear design load: only the unsprung mass --
wheel, tyre, axle, lower oleo -- sees the impact amplification that actually sizes
an axle, and sloads does not model that. :data:`UNSPRUNG_NOTE` is the statement of
record and travels on every rendering.

Three geometry facts the manual already knows, surfaced here
------------------------------------------------------------
**The strut state follows LANDLOAD per attitude** (G-12): the contact patch is
taken from the **compressed** axle for cases 1-12 (level, tail-down, one-wheel)
and the **static** axle for 13-33 (ground roll, side, supplementary nose), each
with its own ground angle. On ``ga6_normal`` the level and ground-roll contact
points differ by 0.49 in in ``x`` and **3.71 in in ``z``** -- 6,706 lb-in of pitch
on the braked-roll drag load -- so following the manual is not a formality.

**The application node does not move.** A trunnion is fixed to the airframe, so
the GIDs are stable across attitudes and the difference lands in the lever arm,
which is where the physics puts it.

**The stroke is more informative than the state names suggest.** Recovered from
the three entered axle positions, ``ga6_normal``'s main leg sits at 24 % of its
7-in stroke in the landing attitudes and 77 % in the handling ones -- impact
versus sitting, which is exactly what a gear analyst needs told.

Frames
------
``GearReactionCase`` carries both resolutions already: the ground-line ("prime")
set ``VMP``/``DMP``/``SMP`` the manual prints, and the airplane-datum set
``vm``/``dm`` it resolves through ``PHIM``/``PHIN``. This module takes each
artifact's own -- it never re-derives the rotation, which would put a second
implementation of ``PHIM`` beside the first. The difference is not cosmetic: on
``ga6_normal`` case 1 the drag is **1,020 lb ground-line against 795 lb
airplane-datum (-22 %)**, and the side family carries 0 lb of ground-line drag
against 186 lb in the airplane datum.

``SMP`` passes through **unrotated** -- it is normal to the pitch rotation --
which is correct but non-obvious, so :func:`ground_rotation_deg` exists to let a
gate assert it rather than let a reader assume it.
