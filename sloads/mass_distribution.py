"""The mass single source of truth: ``weight.items`` -> per-component inertia.

Plan 11 decision **B-2**, step **B1**
(``docs/30_future/11_balanced_airframe_cases_plan.md``). Conventions:
``docs/10_standard/CONVENTIONS.md``.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The suite carried **two independent mass models that never reconciled**:

* ``weight.items`` -- the itemized data base WTONECG/WTENV sum. It closes to the
  airplane weight and CG by construction, and it is the one every mass-property
  deliverable is computed from.
* ``fuselage_mass.stations`` -- a short hand-entered lump table, the only input
  the Ch 15 fuselage beam ever read.
* ``tail_mass`` -- a per-surface panel weight, the only input the spanwise
  empennage distribution ever read. **No shipped fixture ever set one**, so its
  failure mode was quieter and worse than the fuselage's: every h-tail deck in
  the suite was air-only while the item data base carried the tail weight
  correctly the whole time (ga6 42/23 lb, the RJ 520/640). Derived since this
  step -- see :func:`tail_surface_weight`.

Nothing anywhere compared them. Measured 2026-08-08 across the shipped fixtures,
the second is short of the first by:

==========================  ==========  =======  =========  ========
fixture                     item model  entered  shortfall  of beam
==========================  ==========  =======  =========  ========
``ga6_normal``                    3070     2578        492      16 %
``cessna_210``                    3450     3020        430      12 %
``atr42_100``                    32751    25210       7541      23 %
``dhc8_dash8``                    28700    25890       2810      10 %
``concept_regional_jet``         30600     18000      12600      41 %
``concept_heavy``                 16200        0      16200     100 %
==========================  ==========  =======  =========  ========

(The item-model column is every item **not** carried by the wing -- see
:func:`fuselage_beam_stations`. Plan 11 §1.3 quoted 427 lb for ga6 because it
also removed the tail items; they belong on the beam, see "What the beam
carries" below.) ``concept_heavy`` has no station table at all, which is why it
is the one fixture with no body deck.

A 12,600 lb shortfall on a 34,800 lb airplane is not a modelling nicety: every
fuselage inertia load, shear, bending moment and exported body card was computed
from a beam carrying three fifths of the mass it should. This module makes the
itemized data base authoritative and derives the beam from it.

What the beam carries
---------------------
Everything **except** the wing. The h-tail and v-tail hang off the aft fuselage,
so their weight is reacted by the fuselage beam as a point load at their own
station -- excluding them would leave the airplane's mass unaccounted for
between the two models. The wing panel is the one component with its own
distribution (WINGINER, tapered root->tip), and it enters the fuselage beam as
the carry-through *reaction*, not as mass; applying both would double-count it
(the seam rule, plan 11 §4).

So, exactly:

    Σ(items tagged WING) + Σ(fuselage beam stations) == Σ(all items) == W

which :func:`partition_closes` asserts.

Derived by default, entered as an explicit override
---------------------------------------------------
:func:`fuselage_beam_stations` returns the derived table whenever the item data
base can produce one. ``FuselageMassInput.stations`` survives as an **explicit**
override, taken only when ``stations_are_override`` is set -- so a hand-entered
table is a deliberate act rather than a stale file silently outranking the SSOT,
and :func:`fuselage_reconciliation` surfaces the difference either way.
:func:`tail_surface_weight` applies the identical rule to the empennage surface
weights, with :func:`tail_reconciliation` as its reporter.

Component tagging
-----------------
``MassItem.component`` is explicit. Plan 11 §3.1 proposed inferring it from
``(x, y, z)``; that cannot work, because every item in every fixture sits at
``y = 0`` -- the rows are lumped airplane totals on the centreline
(``"Engines (2)"``), which carry no side information. :func:`infer_component` is
the documented fallback for an untagged (pre-B1) file: deliberately conservative,
tagging only what the geometry makes unambiguous and defaulting to
``FUSELAGE`` -- the component whose distribution is a lump table, so a
mis-inferred item lands at its own station and is at worst in the right place on
the wrong beam.

    """The component for an **untagged** item: always :attr:`MassComponent.FUSELAGE`.

    Not a stub — a deliberate refusal to guess, and the honest reading of what
    the data supports. An item's component is a question about *which beam
    reacts its weight*, and the only geometric signal that could answer it is
    the item's spanwise station. **Every item in every shipped fixture sits at
    ``y = 0``**: the rows are lumped airplane totals on the centreline
    (``"Engines (2)"`` is both engines of a wing-mounted twin, entered at
    ``y = 0`` because that is where their combined CG is). Station ``x`` cannot
    separate a wing-mounted engine from a fuselage-mounted one — on
    ``atr42_100`` the wing is at x = 395 and the engines at x = 370, inside the
    fuselage's own x range either way — and a name-based rule would be a
    heuristic dressed as data.

    So the fallback guarantees the **one** thing it can: that the fuselage beam
    is *complete*. Every untagged pound lands on the beam, which is where all
    but the wing belongs anyway, so an untagged file gets a fuselage that is
    right in total and in station — heavier than the truth by the wing panel,
    never lighter, and never silently mis-attributed to a surface.

    What it deliberately does **not** do is let an untagged file pass as
    tagged: :func:`wing_mass_tie` fails loudly on one (nothing is tagged
    ``WING``, so the tie reads 0 against ``2 x panel_weight_lb``), which is the
    correct signal — *tag the items*. See

    """One :class:`CaseLoading` per weight/CG case.

    ``cases`` defaults to the ``FLIGHT``-tagged cases -- what this used to read
    off ``flight_loads.cg_cases``. Decision G-3 generalized it to *any* case list
    so each analysis asks for the cases tagged for it; the ``derivable`` gate and
    the ``SkippedCondition`` record are unchanged, so a ground case whose loading
    the weight database cannot produce is skipped and recorded, never invented,
    exactly as a flight case is.

    **How, and why not the way plan 12 C-1 described.** C-1 proposed deriving
    each loading from WTENV's ballast machinery -- its structural-limit points
    and their reference vertices. Measured 2026-08-08: the fixtures'
    ``cg_cases`` *are* WTENV's structural points on ``ga6_normal`` (the
    Appendix A airplane, built that way) and on **no other fixture** --
    ``concept_regional_jet``'s cases sit at 619/599/595 in against WTENV's
    594/574/569. Worse, WTENV's reference is the forward-loading *sequence*, a
    prefix of the discretionary items sorted by station; targeting the cg cases
    through it derives only 6 of 18 shipped cases, the rest wanting a ballast
    station up to 3800 in off the airplane, or landing on a vertex that already
    weighs the target with the CG 13-60 in away, which no ballast can move.

    So the search is over **discretionary subsets**, not the sorted prefix: any
    combination of the discretionary items may be aboard (dropping aft
    passengers is how a real loading moves its CG forward), plus a ballast row
    solved from the residual. That reaches 16 of 18. The subset count is
    ``2^n`` over 3-7 discretionary items -- 8 to 128 -- so exhaustive search is
    the right algorithm, not an optimisation problem.

    Selection rule, stated so it is not an accident of iteration order: among
    the subsets that reproduce the case within the fuselage extent, take the one
    needing the **least ballast**; ties break toward the larger payload. Least
    ballast is the loading closest to something an operator could actually fly.

    The ballast row's ``x`` **and** ``z`` are both solved (weight from the
    residual, station from the x-moment, waterline from the z-moment), so the
    derived loading matches the case in all three. Its inertias are zero -- a
    point mass, which is what a ballast weight is.

    **All of that is the fallback since D-25.** A case carrying an explicit
    ``loading`` is assembled by :func:`entered_loading` instead: no search, no
    solved ballast, no credibility gate. The search stays because it is what a
    pre-v50 file (and any case still without a loading) runs on, bit-for-bit.
