"""Export the NETLOADS net wing load as sbeam-consumable structural load sets.

This is the C4 *export bridge*: it turns ``Project.loads.wing_net`` (the spanwise
net shear / bending / torsion NETLOADS produces) into the three artifacts sbeam
consumes for structural sizing, matching sbeam's own card style
(``sbeam/results/load_export.py``):

* a **span-load CSV** -- one row per wing station per case, the applied nodal
  loads plus the cumulative shear/BM/torsion for engineering reference;
* **FORCE / MOMENT bulk-data cards** -- comma free-field, unit-scale form
  (``FORCE, SID, GID, 0, 1.0, Fx, Fy, Fz``), one load set per critical case, to
  splice into an existing sbeam model;
* an optional minimal **CBAR stick-model BDF** -- GRID + CBAR + PBAR + MAT1 +
  SPC1 + the load cards + a SOL 101 case-control wrapper, so the load runs
  directly in sbeam.

Case identity in the deck (M4-2)
--------------------------------
Every deck's ``SUBCASE`` and load-set ``SID`` is the case's own id put through
:func:`sloads.case_ids.subcase_id` (``W-03`` -> ``103``), never its position in
the exported list, and each deck opens with a ``$`` subcase-map block naming the
governing condition behind each number (:func:`subcase_map_block`). The exported
case index carries the same number in its ``SUBCASE`` column. A deck consumer can
therefore trace ``SUBCASE 103`` back to "W-03, PHAA, FAR 23.333(b)" from the deck
alone, and a filtered export cannot renumber the subcases that survive.

The bridge is a pure renderer (like :mod:`sloads.io`): the building functions
return strings, the ``write_*`` wrappers do the only file I/O. It is **not** a
registered calc module -- the physics already lives in ``modules/net_loads.py``.

All exported force / moment / pressure magnitudes are **ULTIMATE** loads, since sbeam
sizes structure to ultimate: the calc's LIMIT values x that case's
``safety_factor`` (14 CFR 23.303 -> 1.5 by default; a case already at ultimate
carries 1.0). Coordinates and chord fractions are geometry and are not scaled. The
factor is per *case* and therefore uniform within one exported load set, which keeps
the force/moment-closure guarantees intact (the exported set sums to that case's
factor x the root/total). Every producer mints the field on its result (M4-13), so
``_sf`` reads it directly; ``_SF`` survives only as the default constant tests read.

Nodal loads: the applied set, on the deck's nodes
------------------------------------------------
``WingStationLoad`` stores per-strip forces *and* cumulative shears/moments
(root-first, i.e. ``stations[0]`` carries the integrated total). The exported
nodal load at station ``i`` is the **strip's own applied load** -- ``fx``,
``fz`` and the free torsion ``myy_free`` -- placed at that station's own point.
It is never a difference of a cumulative column.

That distinction is the difference between a deck that works and one that does
not. The cumulative ``Myy`` at a station already contains the sweep and
dihedral transfer of the shear carried outboard of it, so a MOMENT card cut from
its increment and applied at a point by a solver -- which generates that
transfer itself, from the geometry -- counts the transfer twice. Measured
against the published cumulative table, accumulating the old cards tip-inboard
with the rigid-body transfer, the exported torsion was wrong by 151 % / 190 % /
120 % on ``ga6_normal`` (PHAA / TORS / ACRL) and 34 % / 21 % on ``baron_58``,
while shear and both bending columns closed exactly. Rebuilt from the applied
set the worst error over every station of every case of both airplanes is
2.5e-15. Design note: ``docs/30_future/46_applied_wing_load_set_note.md``
(OR-67).

Concentrated masses: the offset couples
---------------------------------------
A **concentrated** wing mass (engine, gear, fuel, store) does not sit on a
station: WINGINER adds it to every station inboard of it at its *true* station
``y_c`` (``mxx[i] += w*(y_c - ye[i])``, WINGINER.BAS 1180-1270), and the stick
model has no grid there. It is therefore reduced to the node inboard of it as
its force plus the **full** three-component offset couple ``r x F`` about that
node -- the exact static equivalent, so nothing moves and the exported set
reproduces the cumulative shear, bending *and* torsion at every node. The
bending members ``mx``/``mz`` are stored in the calc's positive-magnitude
convention (``coordinates.bending_moment_vector`` maps them to CID 0 at the card
writer); the ``my`` member is folded into the node's applied torsion, which is
already body-axis. All three are zero on a wing with no concentrated masses,
which is every fixture the printed oracle covers. Prior design note:
``docs/40_history/19_concentrated_wing_mass_nodal_split_plan.md``, whose
two-component couple this completes.

Torsion reference axis
----------------------
Every exported wing torsion states its chordwise reference axis in-band (the
span-load CSV ``MyyAxis`` column, the BDF ``$`` header comments). The calc
produces torsion about the **25% chord** (oracle-locked); when the export is
built from a ``Project``, the bridge first transfers the wing results to the
surface's **loads reference axis** (LRA, ``SurfaceInput.ref_axis_pct`` --
the beam-model elastic axis, typically 40-50% chord) via
``net_loads.loads_ref_axis_results``, exactly as the limit->ultimate factor is
applied here at the boundary. Callers passing bare ``WingLoadResult`` lists are
responsible for transferring first (the results' ``torsion_axis`` stamp is
exported either way, so the axis is always labelled).

Unit systems (M4-20 step 4)
---------------------------
Every public writer takes ``system=UnitSystem.IMPERIAL|SI`` and resolves it to
the **solver** unit set -- ``deliverable_units(system, Channel.SOLVER)``, i.e.
N / mm / N*mm / MPa in SI. The solver set is deliberately *not* the one a report
uses (N*m, kPa): a deck whose GRIDs are millimetres and whose forces are newtons
is only correct with N*mm moments, and an N*m moment in it is a silent 1000x
torsion error in a file that parses cleanly (decision D-19).

No arithmetic here knows about units. Every dimensional value this module emits
-- card fields *and* CSV cells alike -- goes through
:mod:`sloads.export.coordinates`, which is the single scale point, so a span CSV
can never disagree with the cards beside it. Imperial is the all-1.0 identity, so
an Imperial export takes the same path it always did.

Coordinate / units map: see :mod:`sloads.export.coordinates` (identity axes,
CID 0, plus the unit scale).

class AppliedLoad:
    """One applied load of the wing set: a strip, or a concentrated wing mass.

    The **applied** set, not the carried one: ``fz``/``fx`` are the load the
    strip or the mass exerts and ``myy_free`` the section moment that is not
    already a force acting through an arm. A model that puts ``fz``/``fx`` at
    ``(x, y, z)`` generates every transfer term itself from its own geometry,
    so re-applying them would count them twice -- which is why this record
    carries ``myy_free`` and not the increment of the cumulative ``myy``. The
    two are different quantities and can differ in sign (``ga6_normal`` PHAA,
    inboard strips).

    A concentrated mass is a pure force: ``myy_free`` is zero and ``gid`` is
    ``None``, because the exported deck has no grid at its coordinates (the
    stick model nodes the load stations only). Its ``label`` is the mass's
    entered name.

    **All six components are carried, three of them structurally zero.** A
    consumer building FORCE/MOMENT cards needs the whole vector, and a set that
    published only its non-zero half would leave the reader to decide whether a
    missing column is zero or merely unstated. So:

    * ``fy`` is ``0.0``. The wing chain has no producer for a spanwise strip
      load (``WingStationLoad.f_span`` is the fin's, whose span is airplane
      ``z``), and every delivered wing condition is symmetric or rolling -- no
      lateral condition exists for the wing -- so the zero is a property of the
      load set, not only of the model.
    * ``mxx_free`` and ``mzz_free`` are ``0.0``. A strip applies forces and a
      section moment about the span axis and nothing else; the whole of the
      cumulative ``Mxx`` and ``Mzz`` is those forces acting through spanwise
      arms, which a model regenerates from these coordinates. Publishing a free
      bending here would double count it.

    Moments are stored in the **calc's** sign convention (positive-magnitude
    beam integrals for ``mxx_free``/``mzz_free``), the same as
    :class:`~sloads.models.results.WingStationLoad`; the map to right-handed
    CID-0 body components is :func:`applied_body_moments`, which is the one
    place the ``Mzz -> -z`` asymmetry is applied.

    Values are LIMIT, Imperial (lb, lb-in, in) -- raw calc units, as everywhere
    else in this package; ``safety_factor`` is the case's own limit->ultimate
    factor, and each consumer scales at its own boundary.

# The fuselage net distribution (Ch 15) is a longitudinal beam: each station
# carries an applied vertical force (inertia + tail air load + wing reaction) that
# sums to zero in equilibrium. The export emits a FORCE card (Fz) per station and a
# span-load CSV; there is no applied torsion, so no MOMENT cards.
#
# GIDs are keyed off each station's provenance (``BodyStationLoad.source``), not
# its index in the merged table: the wing carry-through reaction (M4-1) inserts
# extra nodes into the middle of the beam, and an index-based GID would have
# renumbered every mass station aft of the wing whenever the spar stations
# changed. Mass/tail stations therefore keep the historical ``1001 + i`` in
# nose->tail order and the reaction nodes take a disjoint block at ``1501 +``.

# suite whose two surfaces do not share an axis map: the h-tail spans ``y`` and
# loads ``fz``, the fin spans ``z`` and loads ``fy``. That mapping is **not**
# written here -- it comes from ``coordinates.py``, the single owner, which is
# also where the fin's torsion sign is derived (plan 09 §2 axes note).
#
# Two differences from the wing bridge worth knowing:
#
# 1. **No differencing.** The wing writer recovers nodal loads as increments of
#    the cumulative shear, because WINGINER publishes nothing else -- and that is
#    what smears a concentrated wing mass one station inboard (the filed wing
#    export defect). ``tail_span`` publishes the strip loads themselves, so this
#    writer emits them directly and inherits none of it.
# 2. **Supported, not clamped.** The h-tail deck is a full-span member reacted at
#    the fuselage attachment stations the physics defined (decision T-8), not at a
#    root node. The v-tail is root-supported at the fuselage.

    angle and stroke it was computed at, and then the *same* reaction where the
    airframe receives it: the gear reference point, in airplane axes, with the
    lever-arm couple that carried it there. Both ends of the leg, so the two G-12
    artifacts are provably one load seen from two sides.

    **All 33 cases**, against the assembled deck's 24. The 23.499 supplementary
