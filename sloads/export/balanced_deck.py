"""The assembled full-span balanced deck -- the mission's primary loads deliverable.

Plan 11 decisions **B-4/B-5**, step **B5**. Conventions:
``docs/10_standard/CONVENTIONS.md``. Physics and residual closure:
:mod:`sloads.modules.balance`.

Every other deck this package writes is a **view**: a per-component free body, cut
out of the airplane, carrying the cut reaction as an applied load and needing a
clamp to stand up. This one is the airplane -- wing tip to wing tip, nose to tail,
aero and inertia together -- and it needs no constraint to hold, because the loads
balance.

How the deck proves that
------------------------
A free-free model cannot simply be handed to a linear static solve; the stiffness
matrix is singular. sbeam's SOL 101 has no inertia relief either (``SUPORT`` is
honoured by the SOL 144 trim partition only, verified 2026-08-08). So the deck
carries a **statically determinate** support -- one node clamped in all six DOF --
and the claim is not that the model is unconstrained but that the constraint does
nothing:

    the recovered reaction at that node IS the case's residual

which the solver computes from its own assembly of the cards, independently of
anything sloads calculated. "Reactions ~ 0" is therefore the free-free
equilibrium proof, not a modelling convenience. The residual before closure is
stated in the ``$`` header so a reader can see how much of the balance was
computed and how much was relieved.

GID bands
---------
The wing needs **two** bands here, which is new: every previous deck carried a
single half-span. Left and right are separate node runs so an antisymmetric case
(plan 11 B7) can load them differently without renumbering anything.

===================  ==============
band                 GIDs
===================  ==============
right-hand side       ``6001+`` (wing strips; h-tail strips on 23.427(a))
left-hand side        ``6201+``
centreline            ``6401+`` (fuselage masses, tail load, lumped body Cm)
gear reference points ``10001+`` (a ground case's trunnions, decision G-2)
===================  ==============

The two side runs are named for the wing in :mod:`sloads.export.bands` because
the wing is what first needed them; what they carry is every load on that side of
the centreline, which from D-R8 includes the distributed 23.427(a) horizontal
tail. A case assembled at its trim tail load still carries that load lumped on
the centreline run.

The three bands are declared in :mod:`sloads.export.bands`, which owns every
GID/EID/SID run in the suite and proves them disjoint. They were ``4001+`` and
collided with the spanwise tail decks until 2026-08-10 (review F-C1).

The ``SUBCASE``/``SID`` ids are **minted from the case id**, per hand -- see
:func:`case_sids` and :func:`sloads.case_ids.balanced_subcase_id` (decision
D-R7). They were positional until 2026-08-10 (review m1).

The deck allocates its own nodes at each load's true ``(x, y, z)`` rather than
reusing the body deck's ``1001+`` beam line -- see :func:`deck_nodes` for why
flattening the waterlines silently unbalanced it.

What is **not** here
--------------------
No wing carry-through reaction. It is the seam between two free bodies, and in an
assembled model the solver recovers it -- applying it as well would react the wing
twice (plan 11 §4's rule: *a load that a free-body cut introduces is never applied
in the assembled model*). Guarded by
:func:`sloads.modules.balance.carry_sources_absent`.

    Every node is allocated at the load's true ``(x, y, z)``, and the fuselage
    beam's ``1001+`` nodes are deliberately **not** reused. Two reasons, both
    found by checking the deck against its own cards rather than by inspection:

    * the body deck's nodes live on the beam line at ``z = 0``, while the mass
      items they stand for are at real waterlines. The closure's longitudinal
      relief acts through those waterlines, so flattening them loses a real
      pitching moment;
    * an item at the same ``x`` but a different ``z`` (``ga6_normal``'s gear
      wheel at 69 and gear structure at 78) would share a node, and a **ballast**
      item has no beam station at all -- the beam is derived from the untouched
      database, the loading adds a solved ballast row somewhere else entirely.
      Those all collapsed onto one node and cost 3.9-21.9 % of the deck's balance
      while the in-memory case still closed to 1e-13.

    ``skipped`` is the F-C7 record, stated in the deck's own ``$`` block beside
    the case map: what the deck covers is only half the statement, and a
    condition that dropped out is invisible in a deck that lists only what it
    holds. It is derived here when the caller does not supply it, so the block
    can never be silently absent; a caller that already assembled (the Balanced
    Cases page) passes its own record and saves the second pass.

    (:func:`~sloads.report.bdf_comment_block`), applied through the same
    :func:`~sloads.export.sbeam_bridge._stamped` owner every other deck uses:
    the mission's primary deliverable states its own basis when it travels
