"""Single multi-sheet ``.xlsx`` workbook export (Step D8.2).

A spreadsheet-native alternative to the ``.zip`` bundle on the Export page: one
workbook with a tab per module's load-case CSV, the case-index table, and the
tabular (non-BDF) sbeam span-load CSVs. Like :mod:`sloads.export.sbeam_bridge`,
this is a pure renderer -- it re-shapes strings/rows the Export page has already
computed for the CSV/zip channel into DataFrames and writes them to one
in-memory workbook; it performs no new calculation and does no file I/O itself.

BDF card text (``*.bdf``) is intentionally excluded -- it is not tabular data
and belongs in the ``.zip``/individual downloads instead.

**Units are stated per sheet, not per workbook** (review m14). One workbook
carries both channels of the selected system: the module and case-index sheets
are the HUMAN channel (the same tables the per-module CSVs serve), while the
span-load sheets are the SOLVER channel that feeds the sbeam decks -- in SI
``N·m``/``kPa`` beside ``N·mm``/``MPa``. A single workbook-level statement is
therefore wrong for half the sheets, which is a SUMMARY_REPORT.md 3.5/4.7-class
conformance failure ("a per-file units column that disagrees ... is a
conformance failure, not a footnote"). Each data sheet states its own set in
cell ``A1`` above its header row, and the ``Project`` sheet names both channels
and which sheets carry which.
