"""Solve an exported deck in the real sbeam -- the round-trip gate's machinery.

Design note: ``docs/40_history/17_sbeam_roundtrip_ci_harness_plan.md`` (decisions
S-1...S-9). Sibling authority, which this module consumes rather than
reimplements: :mod:`sloads.export.equilibrium`.

The two export-boundary gates answer different questions. ``equilibrium``
re-derives a deck's resultant **from its own card text** -- "do the cards sum to
what the header claims?". This one hands the deck to **another program** and asks
"does a real solver read this file and recover the same loads?". Only the second
one catches card syntax sbeam rejects, a GID reference to nothing, a frame or
sign mismatch, or a case-control error -- and only the second one is evidence
about the mission's actual claim, which is that the deck *solves*.

Production module, test-only *use* -- exactly as ``equilibrium`` is. Nothing in
the shipping path imports it today, and it must stay that way: acceptance point 6
of the design note is that this step changes no exported byte. It lives in
``sloads/`` rather than ``tests/`` because a later runtime "validate this deck"
surface has to consume this authority instead of hand-rolling a second one.

What has to be wrapped, and why
-------------------------------
Only the wing deck is solvable as exported: ``stick_model_bdf`` writes ``SOL
101`` with ``GRID``/``CBAR``/``PBAR``/``MAT1``/``SPC1``. The body and tail decks
are load-cards-only, and the assembled balanced deck carries case control,
``GRID``s and a determinate ``SPC1`` but **no elements** -- it is a load set on a
node cloud, which is all a load deliverable needs to be and is singular to a
linear static solve.

:func:`wrap_as_stick_model` supplies the missing structure from the deck's own
``GRID`` cards (plan 07 decision E-5 put them there; without them this is
unbuildable). It invents no geometry and it is **test-only**: it is never written
by the CLI or the GUI, and L-1 supersedes it with a real assembled stick model.

The support is the point, not a workaround
------------------------------------------
sbeam's SOL 101 has no inertia relief -- ``SUPORT`` is honoured by the SOL 144
trim partition only -- so a free-free deck cannot simply be solved. It is
constrained instead at a **statically determinate** set of DOFs, which carries
exactly the residual the applied set fails to balance, and the assertion is that
the recovered reaction is **zero**. That is a stronger statement than the card
sum: it proves free-free equilibrium through the solver's own assembly, using the
lever arms *it* computes from the deck's ``GRID`` cards rather than sloads' idea
of them. A deck that closes on paper but reacts non-zero here has a geometry
error no card sum can see.

.. rubric:: The 3-2-1 scheme is degenerate on a beam line

The design note proposed the body support as "``z`` at two stations plus ``x`` at
one" -- the classical 3-2-1. That is three constraints, not six, and on a
**collinear** node set it cannot be completed into a determinate one: the
fuselage deck's nodes all lie on ``y = z = 0``, so no combination of translation
constraints restrains rotation about the beam axis, and the solve is singular.
Beam elements carry rotational stiffness at their nodes, so the collinear analog
of 3-2-1 constrains that rotation directly: all three translations plus the
rotation **about the beam's own axis** at one end, and the two perpendicular
translations at the other -- six constraints, no redundancy, reactions still
fixed by statics alone. Which DOFs those are depends on which way the beam runs
(:func:`_determinate_components`); an x-only scheme is exactly singular on the
h-tail's spanwise beam, which runs along ``y``. See :data:`Support`.
