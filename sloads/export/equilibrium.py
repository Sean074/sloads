"""Deck-derived force/moment resultants -- the export-boundary closure gate.

Every deck this package writes makes a **claim about itself** in its ``$``
header: the wing card set "sums to root Sz", the body set "sums to 0 (vertical
equilibrium)" and has a "Terminal Myy (moment equilibrium)", the tail set "sums
to LT25 + LT50". Until this module those claims were verified -- where they were
verified at all -- against *in-memory* objects, by four separately hand-rolled
summations, force-only, Imperial-only.

This module is the single owner of the other half: re-derive Σ``FORCE`` and
Σ``MOMENT`` **from the emitted card text**, about a stated reference point, in
the deck's own units, and hand the caller a :class:`Resultant` to assert
against. Reading the text rather than the objects is the whole point -- it is
the only form that catches the failure modes living at the boundary rather than
in the physics:

* the ``%.6E`` six-significant-figure card format;
* the ``_TOL`` near-zero card suppression;
* a card routed to the wrong ``SID``;
* a ``GRID`` whose coordinate disagrees with the load that references it;
* a unit set whose ``moment.factor`` is not ``force.factor x length.factor``
  (decision D-19) -- invisible to any force-only sum.

Production module, not a test helper (though today only tests call it, per the
step's decision E-4): the sbeam round-trip harness and any later runtime deck
validator must consume this authority rather than reimplement it.

Two moment sums, and the difference matters
-------------------------------------------
:class:`Resultant` carries both:

* ``m0`` -- the applied ``MOMENT`` cards alone, about nothing in particular
  (a free vector);
* ``m``  -- the full rigid-body resultant, ``m0 + Σ (p_gid - ref) x F``.

They answer different questions, and a component asserts whichever one its deck
actually claims. The wing claims ``m.y`` -- the full rigid-body resultant -- and
that is a change of 2026-09-03 (note 46 OR-68). Its ``MOMENT`` cards used to be
increments of the cumulative ``Myy``, which already contained the sweep and
dihedral transfer of the shear carried outboard; only the bare card sum
``m0.y`` closed then, and asserting ``m.y`` would have double-counted the
transfer (the term is of the same order as the torsion itself -- ≈ -93,300
lb-in against a -91,400 lb-in root torsion on ``ga6_normal`` PHAA). The cards
now carry each strip's **free** torsion at its own node, so the transfer is the
solver's to generate and ``m.y`` is the root torsion the WINGINER quadrature
prints. The wing *bending* check has always used ``m.x``, which is exactly the
lift's lever arm about the root station.
