"""Export bridges from SLOADS results to external structural tools.

Currently the sbeam bridge (C4): turns SLOADS component loads into
sbeam-consumable span/chordwise-load CSVs, ``FORCE``/``MOMENT`` bulk-data cards,
and an optional CBAR stick-model BDF. See :mod:`sloads.export.sbeam_bridge`.

The concept deliverable is "all components to sbeam", so the package API exports
all four component families plus the case index:

- **Wing** — :func:`span_load_csv`, :func:`force_moment_cards`,
  :func:`stick_model_bdf` (+ ``write_*`` variants), built from the NETLOADS net
  wing load (``Project.loads.wing_net``).
- **Body / fuselage** — :func:`body_span_load_csv`, :func:`body_force_moment_cards`,
  :func:`body_fitting_load_csv` (the wing-attach fitting loads, reported beside
  the FORCE set rather than in it) — all three with ``write_*`` variants —
  and :func:`body_station_gids`.
- **Tail** — :func:`tail_chordwise_csv`, :func:`tail_force_moment_cards`
  (+ ``write_*`` variants).
- **Control surfaces** — :func:`control_surface_csv`,
  :func:`control_surface_force_moment_cards` (+ ``write_*`` variants).
- **Mass model** — :mod:`sloads.export.mass_cards`: :func:`conm2_fragment`,
  :func:`mass_check_deck` and :func:`inertia_only_cards`, the ``CONM2``/
  ``MASSSET`` export that gives sbeam an *independently parsed* mass model to
  check sloads' inertia loads against. Deliberately **not** re-exported at
  package level beyond these three: the inertia-only set is a comparison
  artifact, never a deliverable, and reaching it stays an explicit import.
- **Closure gate** — :mod:`sloads.export.equilibrium`: :func:`parse_cards`,
  :func:`deck_resultants` and :func:`closes`, the single owner of "re-derive a
  deck's Σ force / Σ moment from its own card text and check the claim its
  header makes". Every deck-closure check in the suite goes through it.
- **Case index, safety-factor table, gear report** — **no longer here.** They
  emit no bulk data and know nothing of a GRID; they are documents, and note 56
  D-56.1 moved them to :mod:`sloads.report.tables`, which is where their
  consumers already were. Import them from there, not from this package.

:mod:`sloads.export.pdf` (Step G8.6) also lives here but is **deliberately not
re-exported**: it is the one module in the codebase that runs a subprocess and
writes a temp directory (compiling the summary report's ``.tex``), so reaching it
stays an explicit ``from sloads.export.pdf import compile_pdf`` at the two call
sites that want it. See its docstring for the documented I/O exemption.
