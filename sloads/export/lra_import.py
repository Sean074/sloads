"""LRA model **import**: an external beam line becomes the loads' target
(step 12, note 24 R-10; implementation note 25 §6).

The export half writes the geometry-derived LRA model; this half accepts a
consumer's own beam model -- a ``GRID``/``CBAR`` BDF subset -- and **uses its
node line as the LRA**: the same balanced-case load sets, the same LM-1
nearest-node transfer with the exact lever-arm couple, landed on the imported
nodes under the imported GIDs (the imported numbering wins). The emitted file
is subcase map + ``FORCE``/``MOMENT`` cards only, ready to splice into the
model it was routed against.

How the import knows which node is which
----------------------------------------
The ``$ SLOADS-NODE <family> <side>`` tags (decision BM-5) -- the same
contract the exported model carries, so an export -> import round trip maps
every family by identity. A model with no tags (or a family it does not tag)
still works: every load falls back to nearest-imported-node over the whole
node set, **marked assumed in the header**, which is the note's stated
fallback. A sidecar map ``{"<family> <side>": gid}`` is accepted as the tag
substitute for a consumer who will not edit their deck.

Because the imported line *is* the consumer's elastic axis, the torsion
reference question is closed by construction and the header says so (R-7d).

Validation
----------
Every tagged node is checked against the geometry-derived position for its
family (the wing SOB, the posts, the fin root...) at
:data:`LRA_IMPORT_TOL_IN`; divergence **raises**, naming both points -- the
T1 planform-validator pattern. An imported model that disagrees with the
project about where the side of body is would silently misstate every
internal load this deliverable exists to state.
