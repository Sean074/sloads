"""CONM2 / MASSSET mass export -- an *independent* mass model for sbeam.

Plan 12 (``docs/40_history/32_conm2_mass_export_plan.md``), steps C3/C4,
decisions C-2/C-3/C-6. Conventions: ``docs/10_standard/CONVENTIONS.md``.

Why this exists
---------------
The ``FORCE``/``MOMENT`` deck is the **total** applied load -- aero plus inertia
-- and stays that way; it is the deliverable. But it is also *self-consistent by
construction*: the inertia half is computed by the same code that writes the
cards, so nothing outside sloads can contradict it. There is no printed oracle
for a distributed inertia load, so that half has, until now, been checked only
against itself.

Exporting the mass distribution as ``CONM2`` cards breaks the circularity. sbeam
parses the mass model independently, applies the case acceleration through a
``GRAV`` card, recovers the nodal inertia loads itself, and the two can be
compared. That is a genuine external check on the half of the load set with no
oracle -- and it is precisely the class of error step B1 turned up (two mass
models disagreeing by up to 41 % of the fuselage beam, unnoticed for want of
anything comparing them).

Not double-counting inertia, structurally
-----------------------------------------
The total ``FORCE``/``MOMENT`` set already contains inertia. A deck that applies
those cards *and* accelerates the CONM2 masses counts it twice -- and decision
C-6 is that this is made impossible rather than warned about, because it is the
one error here that produces a *plausible* wrong answer (a heavier airplane, not
a crash). So:

* :func:`mass_check_deck` emits **no** ``FORCE``/``MOMENT`` cards at all. Its
  subcases carry ``MASSSET`` + ``GRAV`` and nothing else.
* :func:`inertia_only_cards` (C-4) emits sloads' own inertia contribution as a
  separate, clearly-marked load set for comparison -- and its header says in
  as many words that it must not be applied together with the total set.

Card syntax is sbeam's own (``sbeam/model/mass.py``,
``sbeam/parser/bdf_reader.py``): ``CONM2, EID, GID, CID, M, X1, X2, X3, I11,
I21, I22, I31, I32, I33`` and ``MASSSET, SID, LABEL, SCALE`` followed by
``+, ADD|REPLACE|DELETE, eid...`` continuation rows. A ``MASSSET`` modifies a
**baseline** (the model's own mass plus baseline ``CONM2``s); EIDs named by
``ADD`` are overlay-only and are excluded from that baseline. This module uses
that split directly: the always-aboard items are the baseline, and each payload
case ``ADD``s the discretionary items and ballast it carries.

Units
-----
``CONM2``'s ``M`` is **mass**, and the weight database stores **weight**. The
conversion is the ``mass`` channel added at step C2
(:func:`sloads.units.deliverable_units`), which is the only dimension in the
suite whose Imperial factor is not 1.0 -- see :data:`sloads.units.LB_TO_SLINCH`.
A mass set written with a weight-valued ``M`` is wrong by 386x in a file that
parses cleanly, so :func:`_checked_mass_units` refuses a unit set that does not
satisfy ``force / (mass x length) == g``.
