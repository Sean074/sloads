"""Rigid-body d'Alembert relief -- the single owner of the closure field.

Plan 13 (``docs/25_notes/18_b8a_lateral_closure_plan.md``) decisions **L-2** and
**L-3**, step B8a-2. Conventions: ``docs/10_standard/CONVENTIONS.md`` §1 (axes and
signs) and §7 (single-source owners).

A balanced free-free case closes its residual by accelerating the airplane: the
loads that do not balance are reacted by the mass, exactly as they are in flight.
The field that does it is the **rigid-body d'Alembert field**

.. code-block:: text

    f_i = -m_i (a_cg + omega_dot x r_i)

and this module is the one place it is written. Before B8a-2 the suite carried
three hand-rolled one-component slices of it -- ``fz = -w*dn`` for the vertical
DOF, ``fz = +k*w*dx`` for pitch, ``fz = -k*w*dy`` for roll -- each correct as far
as it went and each missing the companion component that makes the *moment* the
field produces equal ``-[I]{omega_dot}`` rather than ``-Sum w*d^2``. Measured
(plan 13 §3.6), the three omissions were worth 0.08 %, 7 % and 55 % of their
own degree of freedom: three different magnitudes from one omission, which is the
argument for writing the field once instead of a fourth and fifth special case.

Weight-space, and why ``omega_dot`` is in 1/in
----------------------------------------------
Everything here is in the suite's Imperial internal channel and in **weight**
rather than mass: an item contributes ``w_i`` (lb), not ``w_i/g``. That is not a
convenience -- it is what makes the translational DOF come out directly as load
factors (``n = F/W``, in g) the way FAR 23 states them, and it is the convention
``balance._closure`` has used since B2.

The consequence is that the inertia terms are ``Sum w*d^2`` in **lb-in^2** (the
same units ``MassItem.ixx`` is entered in and ``WTONECG`` reports, so the two
producers are directly comparable -- gate G4), and the angular accelerations that
come out of ``[I]{omega_dot} = {M}`` are in **1/in**, i.e. g per inch of arm.
Multiply by :data:`sloads.units.G_IN_S2` for rad/s^2, or use
:func:`radians_per_s2`. The force the field applies stays in lb throughout, with
no gravity constant anywhere in the arithmetic.

The tensor's sign convention
----------------------------
:class:`InertiaTensor` stores the **products of inertia as sums**, ``ixy = Sum
w*dx*dy``, not as the negated off-diagonal entries of the matrix. That is the
form ``WTONECG`` prints (``IXZ``, Appendix A p136) and the form a reader
checking it against a handbook expects; the negation happens once, in
:meth:`InertiaTensor.matrix`. Getting this backwards is a sign error that no
symmetric case can see -- ``ixy`` and ``iyz`` vanish for a mirror-symmetric mass
model -- so it is stated here and gated in ``tests/test_rigid_body.py``.

#: this module is Imperial-internal weight-space arithmetic, which the suite
