"""Project JSON load/save and CSV writing.

The on-disk format is one ``project.json`` per airplane. This module is the only

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Tolerant reader (M2R-7): the one place every ``*_from_dict`` filters a raw dict
# down to its dataclass's fields before the ``cls(**d)`` splat. A file carrying an
# unknown key -- hand-edited, or written by a build whose schema had a field this
# one does not -- must LOAD, dropping the unrecognized field, not crash with
# ``TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument``. Since #93 a file
# of another *version* never gets this far (``migrations.migrate`` refuses it), so
# what this guard covers is an unknown key inside an otherwise current file.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Numbers in, numbers stored (#76, C210-7 residual). A grid cell rendered from an
# object-typed column comes back as text, so a project saved mid-entry can hold
# ``["45", "0"]`` where a wing corner belongs. Nothing on the read side looked:
# ``_points`` coerced the *shape* (list -> tuple) and passed the members through,
# and every ``_filtered`` splat passed its list straight to the dataclass. The
# file then loaded cleanly and died later, twice over -- ``TypeError: unsupported
# operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'`` in WINGGEOM, and the same in
# ``to_display`` on the main GUI's layout page, which is the page that would
# otherwise repair the corners.
#
# The rule is stated once, for the whole class rather than for the corner that
# found it: a field annotated as a container **of numbers** is loaded as numbers.
# The shapes are read off the dataclass annotations (never a hand-kept list, so a
# new numeric field is covered the day it is added), text that parses is repaired
# with a ``warnings.warn`` the GUI shows as a toast (``project_state.safe_load``,
# the #66/PB-7 channel), and text that does not parse raises ``ValueError`` naming
# the field and the member -- one of the types the load path already catches and
# shows as ``st.error``. Scalars are deliberately NOT *coerced* here: this is the
# grid-writable container class, and a blanket coercion of every numeric field
# would have to reason about ``Optional``, enums and bools as well.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# A JSON ``null`` is refused where ``None`` is not a value (#121). The scalar
# half of the same boundary, and the one thing about a scalar this module *can*
# decide without reasoning about coercion: whether the field's own annotation
# admits ``None``. It did not look, so ``"full_down_aileron_deg": null`` loaded
# into a field declared ``float = 0.0`` and the main GUI died three modules away
# on ``float(None)`` -- a raw ``TypeError`` out of a widget, on a file this
# module had already accepted. ``None`` is not repairable the way text is (the
# author's intent -- the default, or a value they meant to type -- is not
# recoverable from the file), so it is refused by name rather than defaulted:
# defaulting is the silent zeroing the LIMNZ derive refuses for the same reason
# (#122). The nullable set is read off the annotations, so an ``Optional`` field
# keeps its meaningful ``None`` and a new field is covered the day it is added;
# an unresolvable annotation stays permissive. No project this app writes can
# trip it -- every model field whose default is ``None`` is annotated
# ``Optional`` (guarded in ``tests/test_io_nulls.py``).
