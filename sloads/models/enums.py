    (empty / minimum / discretionary — the WTONECG/WTENV loading hierarchy),
    ``component`` says *where its weight is reacted* — which beam carries it, and
    therefore which distributed load set it belongs to.

    This is the partition :mod:`sloads.mass_distribution` needs to turn
    ``weight.items`` into per-component station inertia, so that the fuselage
    beam, the wing spanwise distribution and (later) the CONM2 export all read
    one mass model instead of three.

    item in *every* shipped fixture has ``y = 0`` — the entries are lumped
    airplane totals on the centreline (``"Engines (2)"``, ``"Nacelles (2)"``), a
    correct convention for CG and inertia about the airplane axis, but one that
    carries no side information at all. Inference on ``(x, y, z)`` would tag the
