    ``leading_edge``/``trailing_edge`` are lists of ``(X, Y)`` points ordered
    inboard -> outboard (fuselage station X, butt line Y, both inches), exactly as
    the original program prompts for them. ``elements`` is the strip count the
    chord is integrated over (``H`` in WINGGEOM.BAS; the Appendix A wing uses 20).
    ``symmetric`` marks a surface symmetric about the airplane centre plane (wing,
    horizontal/vertical tail) versus one defined on a single side (aileron, flap).

    ``ref_axis_pct`` is the surface's **loads reference axis** as a fraction of
    the local chord — the elastic axis of the beam model the exported loads are
    applied to (typically 0.40–0.50 of chord for a wing box). The calc itself
    stays on the original suite's 25% chord (AIRLOADS/WINGINER/NETLOADS,
    oracle-locked); the cumulative torsion is *transferred* to this axis at the
    render/export boundary (``net_loads.to_loads_ref_axis``). ``None`` means
    "not entered" (v52, note 24 R-7c): every reporting consumer reads the
    effective value through :attr:`ref_axis`, which falls back to the original
    quarter-chord (so a bare project keeps the oracle reporting exactly), while
    the LRA beam-model exporter — a *structural* consumer, for which a beam on
    an unstated axis is the silently-defaulted case — refuses ``None`` rather
    than assuming.

    ``front_spar_pct``/``rear_spar_pct`` are the surface's front and rear spar
    stations as fractions of the local chord. For the wing they locate the
    **carry-through** the fuselage's unbalanced moment is reacted over (Ref 1
    Ch 15 p103; :func:`sloads.derived_geometry.carry_through`, backlog M4-1).
    ``None`` means "not entered": the resolver then assumes
    :data:`~sloads.constants.DEFAULT_FRONT_SPAR_PCT` /
    :data:`~sloads.constants.DEFAULT_REAR_SPAR_PCT` and marks the result
    ``assumed``, so an assumed spar location is never reported as input.

    ``sob_y_in`` is the surface's **side-of-body butt line** (in) -- where the
    surface structurally attaches to the fuselage. One quantity, two consumers
    (decision BM-1): the wing side-of-body reporting node, and the h-tail
    fuselage attachment pair. ``None`` means "not entered": the resolver
    (:func:`sloads.derived_geometry.sob_station`) then falls back to half the
    fuselage width **marked assumed**, and never to ``wing_mass.inboard_rib_y``,
    which is the WINGINER mass-panel start, not a body dimension.

    ``tip_cap_width_in`` (v56, note 36 OV-4) is the **rounded tip cap's width**
    (in) -- the planform rounding the edge polylines cannot carry, because they
    end square by construction. It is geometry, entered once with the surface

class LoadingDefinition:
    """Which useful load is aboard for one weight/CG case (decision **D-25**).

    A ``CgCase`` states a weight and a CG -- a corner of the weight/CG envelope,
    which is the real engineering input on a reference airplane. It does **not**
    say *what loading produces it*, and on 5 of 6 shipped fixtures no combination
    of the item data base reaches the entered point within a credible ballast
    fraction, so those cases produce no mass model and no balanced case at all.
    D-25 (user, 2026-08-15): the corner points stand and the **loading becomes an
    explicit input**, because the loading is the derived quantity of the two.

    The database stays the mass SSOT (plan 11 B1) -- nothing here duplicates a
    weight:

    * ``aboard`` names the **discretionary** rows of ``weight.items`` that are
      carried. ``EMPTY`` and ``MINIMUM`` rows are *implicitly* aboard: a loading
      is a statement about the useful load, and neither the empty weight nor the
      minimum-flight-weight rows (pilot, reserve fuel) are optional. Naming one
      is rejected as an entry error, on the reasoning that made G-3c reject an
      empty ``analyses`` set.
    * ``fractions`` scales a row tagged ``consumable`` (G-5) to a partial value --
      a part-full tank -- keyed by item name, in ``(0, 1]``. It applies to a
      consumable of any kind, named in ``aboard`` or implicitly aboard; the
      station and inertias are unchanged, so the tank layout is preserved exactly
      as the derived burn-down preserves it. ``0`` is rejected: "not aboard" is
      said by omitting the name, not by a zero.
    * ``ballast`` is an explicit ballast row, entered when the loading needs one.
      Its waterline is **required, not defaulted** -- ``zcg`` is checked against
      it. Where the data base already carries a ballast row (``ga6_normal`` has
      one), name it in ``aboard`` instead.

    The loading is **authoritative** (D-25a): the case's ``weight_lb``/``xcg``/
    ``zcg`` become a checked echo of what this produces, not a target the loading
    is bent to hit. See ``docs/40_history/25_d25_cgcase_loading_note.md``.

    of the CG (inches). Entered explicitly for now; a later step seeds these from
    ``Project.weight.envelope``.

    **Since step 10 piece 2 this list is the only one** (decision G-3): the case
    states which analyses it is run for, instead of being copied into a
    per-analysis list. ``analyses`` is a *set* so one case may feed several
    (``{FLIGHT, GROUND}``) rather than being entered twice under two names and
    drifting apart; an empty set is rejected by validation, because a case that is
    run for nothing is an entry error, not a state (G-3c). The default
    ``{FLIGHT}`` is today's behaviour, so a directly-constructed test project is
    unchanged.

    ``role`` (G-3a) is how LANDLOAD is fed: it consumes the three ``GROUND`` cases
    that carry roles, **in role order**, retiring both the positional contract and
    the name matching against ``validation.LANDING_CG_NAMES``. A further

    Deliberately simpler than :class:`WingMassInput`: the plan's decision T-3 is a

    no concentrated-mass list. The strip inertia is therefore
    ``-n_case * panel_weight_lb * (c_j*dy)/S``, i.e. the surface weight shared out
    by strip *area*.

    ``panel_weight_lb`` is the **whole surface**: both sides for the horizontal

    quantity in the suite is stated (``htail_area_sqft`` is both-sides, and

    two anywhere in the tail path.

    Sign is d'Alembert and set by the load factor **alone** (decision T-9): the
    inertia load is ``-n``, never "opposing the air load". The governing GA6
    h-tail conditions are *down*-load cases, so a magnitude-opposing rule would

    LGFACTOR (FAR 23.473(d)-(g)) estimates the landing load factor from the
    drop-test work-energy balance: the limit descent velocity ``V = 4.4*(W/S)^0.25``
    (clamped 7-10 fps), the flat-tyre deflection ``(OD - hub)/6`` and the strut
    stroke, with tyre/strut efficiencies (0.3 tyre; 0.5 spring / 0.75 oleo). The
    airplane load factor ``N`` is the absorbed energy ratio and the gear factor is
    ``NLG = N - L`` (both returned on ``LoadFactorResult``; M2R-4 removed the
    write-back ``n`` field -- rendering the page must not mutate the project).
    The **governing** N may be entered on ``airplane_load_factor`` (note 37: the
    manual's LANDLOAD runs at a rounded design N, 3.167 on p230); NLG is always
    derived as ``N - L``, so a change to the wing lift factor L always moves the
    gear reaction. The old ``gear_load_factor`` NLG override (removed at schema
    v57) made L inert -- see ``modules/landing.py:governing_load_factors``.

    LANDLOAD (FAR 23.473-23.499) then computes the tricycle-gear reaction loads for
    the level, tail-down, one-wheel, braked-roll, side and supplementary-nose-wheel
    ground conditions, reading the per-CG weight & CG from the three **roled**
    ``GROUND`` weight/CG cases (aft max landing, fwd max landing, fwd light; UG
    fig 18.2) -- resolved by :func:`sloads.cg_cases.landing_role_cases`, since
    decision G-3b retired this slice's own ``cg_cases`` list into the shared one.
    ``Project.mass`` is not read at all (M2-8 removed the auto-derivation -- a
    single heaviest mass case cannot supply distinct fwd/aft stations), so the
    landing workflow step requires no ``mass`` slice (M4-17a).

    The reduced landing weight (FAR 23.473(b)/(c); typically 0.95*MTOW) applies to
    the level / tail-down / one-wheel cases; the side, braked-roll and nose
