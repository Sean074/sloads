"""Unit-system conversion at the input/output boundary.

The calculation core (:mod:`sloads.modules.engine`) works exclusively in the
Imperial units of the original ENGLOADS.BAS, so it reproduces the FAR 23 LOADS
manual's worked examples within tolerance. To offer SI input/output without
touching that physics, this module converts:

* SI **inputs** -> Imperial, before a run (:func:`to_imperial`), and
* Imperial **results** -> SI, for display/report (:func:`convert_results`).

Imperial is the canonical internal system; SI is purely a presentation choice.

# because the suite has no canonical mass unit to be identical to: the canonical
# quantity is a pound of *force*, and a consistent Imperial deck (lbf, in, s)
# measures mass in lbf*s^2/in. Hence the factor below, and hence this block is
# exempt from the all-1.0 rule the other dimensions follow (which is why

# 386.088 alongside 9806.65 would break it in the eighth digit for no reason.
#
