"""Single-source geometry derivations (Step M2-6).

The wing scalars several slices used to carry as independently-editable copies --
``FlightLoadsInput.mac``/``wing_area_sqft``/``xw``/``zw``,
``WingMassInput.dihedral_deg``/``wrp_waterline``, ``LandingInput.wing_area_sqft`` --
and the fuselage ``LayoutInput.fuselage_length``/``_width``/``_height`` are now
**derived** from the single source of truth, ``Project.geometry`` (the WINGGEOM wing
surface + the parametric wing + the fuselage outline).

:func:`wing_reference` computes the wing quantities from geometry; :func:`fuselage_summary`
the fuselage length/width/height from the outline. :func:`sync_geometry_derived` writes
the derived values onto the consuming slices; every module that reads them calls it first.
(Landing gear was a sibling of this pattern until M2R-4 made it pure: `landing.build_landing`
now resolves ``geometry.landing_gear`` onto a local effective-input copy instead of writing
onto ``Project.landing``.) When the wing/parametric/outline
geometry is absent (a directly-constructed test project) the sync is a no-op, so an
explicitly-set slice value still flows through -- exactly the STRSPEED wing-area fallback.

The derived values are deliberately **not** serialized (see ``io.py``); the GUI shows them
read-only. So there is no independently-editable copy and a save->reload is a no-op.

    **Why this is worth an owner at all.** The magnitude of the body-axial load is
    fixed by definition (``vn.dx - sum(fx of the wing strips)``) and its fuselage
    station reaches no gate -- a pure axial force contributes ``my = (z-zcg)*fx``,
    with no ``x`` term. So this waterline is the *entire* free parameter of the
    body drag carrier, and it moves the pre-closure pitch residual one-for-one.

    Resolution order -- deliberately **two** branches::

        explicit body_drag_waterline_z -> use it                  (assumed False)
        otherwise                      -> zw, with a loud note    (assumed True)

    There is no geometry branch, and its absence is the decision. The obvious
    candidate, ``root_waterline_z``, is the datum ``tail_geometry.fin_root_waterline``
    measures "the top of the fuselage" from -- but it is the **wing** root, and
    using it puts ``ga6_normal``'s ``SIDE GUST`` pitch residual at -1.173 %,
    over the 1 % gate, on the Appendix A fixture. It would also be a trap rather
    than merely wrong: ``ga6_normal`` carries ``fuselage_height = 0.0``, so any
    branch conditioned on body geometry would *flip* the first time a fixture
    gained a body outline -- a fixture-data change silently moving a gate.

    ``zw`` is the fallback because it is the trim's own assumption
    (``flight_envelope._balance`` lumps the whole airplane-less-tail force system
    at ``(xw, zw)``), so a project that has not stated where its body is asserts
    nothing this suite cannot support. It is also the most robust point available:
    the residual is zero there and grows linearly either side, so ``zw`` sits at
    the **centre** of the band within which every gated case passes -- +/-10.6 in
    on ``concept_regional_jet``, +/-8.0 in on ``ga6_normal``. A later measured
