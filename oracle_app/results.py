"""The oracle GUI's one results renderer, built from the workflow SSOT.

Design note 32, step **OG-E**. The same argument as the input form one level on:
there are fourteen oracle pages and no fourteen output blocks. A page's programs
are :func:`sloads.workflow.step_modules` -- its own ``module`` plus the
contributors folded into it, which together are what its ``bas`` string claims
-- so Weight & Mass Properties runs WTESTIMA, WTONECG and WTENV because
``workflow.py`` says it does, not because this file names them.

**Every artifact comes from an owner** (OG-6). Load cases are
:func:`sloads.io.load_cases_csv` with :func:`~sloads.report.csv_comment_block`,
and the text report is :func:`sloads.report.module_text_report` -- the same two
calls ``cli.py`` makes, so the ULT marker and the per-case SF statement are
identical by construction rather than by resemblance. There is no CSV writer
here and no unit factor here; the deliverable system is resolved once, in the
shell, and handed to the owners.

**The station tables.** OG-6 named two owners, which gives a page its load cases
and nothing else -- and the load cases are not what AIRLOADS, NETLOADS or
TAILDIST *print*. Their printed output, the output Appendix A is, is the
spanwise/chordwise station table, which lives in ``ModuleResult`` nowhere: it is
built from ``wing_load_rows``/``body_load_rows``/``build_tail_chordwise`` and
rendered by :mod:`app_shell.limit_csv`, the shared shell owner OG-B extracted
for exactly this channel. OG-6 is amended (2026-08-20, owner) to name it as a
third owner, because an oracle GUI that cannot show the oracle's own printout is
not one. Those tables are **LIMIT** -- the oracle-traceable calc values, the
``CONVENTIONS.md`` analysis-page carve-out -- and say so in-band, in the
``Basis`` column and in the ``*_LIMIT.csv`` filename.

:data:`STATION_TABLES` is keyed by *module* name, not by page key: which row
builder a program has is a fact about the program, and keying on the page would
put a step key back in the GUI (gate G2).

**One download call site.** :func:`step_results` returns the blocks and their
:class:`Artifact` payloads as data, and :func:`render_results` is the only place
that turns one into an ``st.download_button``. Gate **G7** reads the payloads
directly, so what it checks is the bytes the user gets, not a source pattern
that resembles them -- and a second call site would be an artifact the gate had
never seen, which ``tests/test_oracle_gui.py`` fails on.
