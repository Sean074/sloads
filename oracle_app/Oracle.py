"""sloads — the **oracle GUI** entry point (design note 32, step OG-D).

Run with:  streamlit run oracle_app/Oracle.py    (or: sloads-oracle)

A second, independently launched front-end over the *same* ``sloads`` calc
package, exposing only the capability of the original McMaster **FAR 23 LOADS**
suite: the original programs' inputs, and nothing this replication added. It is
not a mode of ``app/`` and shares no page with it — the two are peers over one
analysis model (OG-1), and everything they genuinely share (the project in
session state, the dirty guard, the units toggle, the project-file widget, the
unit-input boundary) lives in :mod:`app_shell`, owned once (OG-4/G8).

**Its page set is derived, not listed** (OG-2, gate G2):
:func:`sloads.workflow.oracle_steps` is the owner, and the rule is *runs a
``.BAS`` program, or produces a slice such a step requires*. Adding a ``bas`` to
a workflow step therefore adds a page here with no edit to this file. There are
no per-page view files either: every page is :func:`oracle_app.form.render_step`
bound to a step key, and what it shows comes from
:mod:`sloads.field_registry` — which is why fourteen pages cost one renderer.

**What it deliberately does not have.** Plots, the sbeam decks, the workbook,
``app/``'s summary report, the concept-mode pages and every sloads-only field:
all still fully available in ``app/``, none of them reachable from here.
**Amended for milestone 0.8.2 (design note 44, OR-3/OR-16):** this GUI now
carries one page that is not a workflow step -- ``Report``, which generates a
formal technical report of *this* front end's own analysis and writes it as an
issue package. It is registered on ``st.navigation`` below and deliberately not
in ``register_pages``: that mapping is the derived step set (gate G2) and stays
exactly that, so the report page can never be mistaken for an analysis step or
be reached by a cross-page step link. A project saved by
either GUI opens in the other unchanged (OG-13, gate G6) — this front-end asks
for less, it does not store anything different.
