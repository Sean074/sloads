"""How the oracle GUI spells things.

Two renderers turn a schema or module name into a heading -- the input form
(:mod:`oracle_app.form`) and the results block (:mod:`oracle_app.results`) --
and a page that writes "H-tail" above its inputs and "Htail" above its results
has two label owners and will drift. One table, one function, imported by both.

Presentation only: nothing here is data, and nothing here decides what a page
shows.

#: Field labels that :func:`pretty` cannot reach, because the schema leaf is not
#: a shortened version of the field's name -- it is a *code*. ``xt25`` is the

#: the forward CG limit that applies at every weight; ``elevator_aft_hinge_sqft``
#: is an *area aft of the hinge line*, not a hinge. Prettifying those gives
#: *Xt25*, *Fwd Regardless Pct MAC* and *Elevator Aft Hinge*, which name nothing

#: Keyed by schema **leaf** name, so one entry covers every path that ends in it
#: (both gear legs' ``carrier``, every surface's ``taper_ratio``). The value is
#: the whole label: the unit suffix is still appended by the widget, so a label
#: here must not state its own unit. Hand-written and therefore guarded --
#: ``tests/test_oracle_gui.py`` fails on a key that names no schema leaf, so a
#: renamed field cannot leave a label behind pointing at nothing.
