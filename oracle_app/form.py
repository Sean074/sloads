"""The oracle GUI's one page renderer, built from the field registry.

Design note 32, step **OG-D**. There are fourteen oracle pages and no fourteen
page files: :func:`render_step` renders *any* of them from
:mod:`sloads.field_registry`, which already says — per field — which page edits
it, whether the original suite asked for it, and what settles that claim. A page
is therefore the set of registry rows whose ``page`` is this step's key and whose
path is in :func:`~sloads.field_registry.oracle_input_paths`, and the widget for
each row is derived from three owners:

* **shape** — :func:`sloads.field_registry.field_type`, the resolved annotation,
  which decides number vs text vs checkbox vs select vs table;
* **unit** — :func:`sloads.units.field_unit`, the schema's three-way answer
  (converted / aviation-standard / dimensionless), rendered through the shell's
  :func:`~app_shell.components.unit_number_input` boundary so this module holds
  no factor of its own (gate G1);
* **provenance** — the registry row's ``basis``, shown as the field's help, so
  every widget in this GUI can name the ``.BAS`` program that asked for it.

Nothing here computes a load, and nothing here holds a second copy of a page
list: adding a ``bas`` to a workflow step adds a page with no edit to this file
(gate G2), and adding a field to ``models/inputs.py`` adds a widget once the
registry classifies it (gate G4).

**Widget keys.** Every widget here is keyed by what it edits — the registry path,
plus the row index where one path is N widgets — and stamped with the project
generation through :func:`app_shell.widget_keys.widget_key`. Without the stamp
those keys are identical across projects, and Streamlit's retained widget state
beats the ``value=`` this renderer seeds from the project: a page visited before
a load re-rendered its own old values and, since the renderers below persist what
they return, wrote them back over what was just loaded (#51).

**What is hand-declared, and why.** :data:`MEMBER_LABELS` names the members of
the composite fields — an ``XYPoint`` is (X, Z) on a gear leg and (X, Y) on a
planform, and no amount of type introspection can tell them apart. It is
presentation only, never data, and ``tests/test_oracle_gui.py`` fails if a
composite field in the input set is missing from it, so a new one cannot quietly
render as "1, 2".
