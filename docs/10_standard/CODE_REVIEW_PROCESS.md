# Code Review Process — sloads

Authoritative process guide for critical code review in this repository. Reviews
**must** be critical: identify defects, non-conformance to the documentation and
the reference manual, and deviations from the porting contract — not just style.

The unit of work here is **porting one suite program** (`.BAS` → a
`sloads/modules/<name>.py` module) or changing an existing one. This guide is
specialised for that.

## 0. Review tiers, scoping, and cadence (2026-08-05 process review)

Review depth scales with the change, matching the S/M/L closure tiers in `CLAUDE.md`:

| Change tier | Review required |
|---|---|
| **S** (small fix, hygiene, docs, display-only) | **Light checklist only:** `ruff` + `pytest` green (oracle and closure gates run with the suite); `CONVENTIONS.md` consulted if units/signs/IDs are touched; same-class defect sweep done; closure tier done. No numbered review steps. |
| **M** (behavior change, existing capability) | Steps 1 and 8, plus **only the ordered steps (2–7) whose areas the diff touches**. |
| **L** (new module / load case / physics / schema change) | The full ordered process below, plus the **design-note-before-code** check: theory reference, `CONVENTIONS.md` citations, and the oracle/closure target with expected numbers agreed *before* implementation. |

**Scoping rule (all tiers):** steps 2–7 apply only to areas the diff touches — do not
walk the porting checklist for a view-layer change.

**The PR is the review unit (design note 28, 2026-08-16 — `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md`).**
The reviewer is never the author; a path in `.github/CODEOWNERS` needs its owner's
approval; one approval is the merge requirement (`self-merge-ok` tier-S docs/hygiene
PRs excepted, on green CI). Findings are PR review comments in the format below —
filed with bodies, in the PR, never carried to a later session — and "closure in a
follow-up" is a `[MAJOR]` (Step 1). An oracle deviation is approved by the owner of
`02_approved_corrections.md` **in the PR**, which is where the approval is recorded.

**Cadence:** hold a scheduled light review every ~2 weeks or every ~5 closed steps,
whichever comes first, instead of letting findings accumulate into large review waves
(the 2026-07-21 wave spawned the entire M2R + M4 sequence at once).

**Review hygiene (lessons from the project's own defect history):**

1. **File findings with bodies in the same session they are raised** — a severity-tagged
   name list is not a finding.
2. **Generalize on first find:** a confirmed defect is swept across its class in the
   same fix, with a guard test where feasible (M4-11a found four sibling defects "by
   building the helper"; the stale `GUI_design.md` schema line recurred until M4-16's
   guard test).
3. **Make it structural:** if a review finds the same convention enforced by prose in
   more than one place, the fix is a single-source code owner + drift-guard test (the
   `CONVENTIONS.md` SSOT table), not another prose reminder.

## 1. Objectives

| Objective | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Numerical fidelity to the manual** | A load module that is silently 5% off produces an unsafe or uneconomic structure. The Appendix A/B figures are the oracle. |
| **Reference-traceability** | Every equation must trace to Reference 1; an un-cited formula cannot be reviewed or trusted. |
| **Documentation conformance** | `CLAUDE.md` mandates `docs/` stay in sync with every code change. |
| **Porting-contract conformance** | The module pattern (pure calc, shared result types, self-registration) is what keeps modules copy-of-the-pattern. |
| **Preserved engineering conventions** | Sign conventions and BASIC truncations are deliberate; "fixing" them silently changes results. |
| **Maintainability** | 22 modules will share this code; debt compounds. |

## 2. Pre-Review Checklist

Complete before reading a single line of diff:

- [ ] Read the commit/PR intent.
- [ ] Open the module's section in [`PROGRAM_SPEC.md`](PROGRAM_SPEC.md) and the relevant Reference 1 chapter (`reference/FAR23Loads_Code.pdf`).
- [ ] Confirm the diff includes documentation updates (`docs/`) — flag immediately if absent.
- [ ] Confirm [`../30_future/00_backlog.md`](../30_future/00_backlog.md) was updated (item removed) and [`../40_history/00_completed_development.md`](../40_history/00_completed_development.md) + `CHANGELOG.md` updated if a module/step closed.
- [ ] Confirm a `tests/test_<module>.py` exists with Appendix A and/or B assertions.

---

## 3. Review Process (ordered)

### Step 1 — Documentation compliance audit (non-negotiable)

Per `CLAUDE.md`, every code change updates `docs/` in the same session. Check:

- [ ] `docs/10_standard/PROGRAM_SPEC.md` — the module's spec row/section reflects the actual inputs, outputs, and FAR conditions implemented.
- [ ] No standard doc states a volatile number (schema version, test count, coverage %, "currently N") — it points at the owner (`00_program_overview.md` §Documentation currency; `tests/test_doc_currency.py` fails on the known patterns, but a reviewer catches the shape the regex does not).
- [ ] `docs/10_standard/PROJECT_GUIDE.md` — any change to package layout, the `Project` schema, or a porting convention is reflected.
- [ ] `docs/20_theory/00_theory_sources.md` — the module has a per-module equation-citation row.
- [ ] `docs/30_future/00_backlog.md` — the ported module is **removed** from the backlog.
- [ ] `docs/40_history/00_completed_development.md` — the module is **added** with its full step record.
- [ ] `changes/` — a `<slug>.<type>.md` fragment exists (`CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` is never hand-edited; `changes/README.md`).

The required depth follows the S/M/L closure tier in `CLAUDE.md` — a Tier-S change needs
the fragment + backlog removal only (no history entry), not the full sweep above.
**Raise as `[MAJOR]`** (blocking) if the closure tier was not completed; documentation
drift blocks approval but is not the same severity class as a wrong load value.

### Step 2 — Reference traceability

- [ ] Every non-trivial equation cites its source (FAR section and/or Reference 1 page) in a comment or the spec.
- [ ] Constants come from `sloads/constants.py`, not bare literals — and `math.pi`, **not** `3.1416` (the modernize-the-math decision).
- [ ] The test keeps the manual's **printed figure plus a page citation** next to each assertion, so drift is traceable.

### Step 3 — Numerical fidelity

- [ ] Tolerance oracle is used correctly: `math.isclose(..., rel_tol=1e-3)` (±0.1%) for real-valued figures; **exact** equality only for integer/dimensionless quantities (counts, load factors).
- [ ] Preserved BASIC truncations (`int(x*1000)/1000`) are kept **where and only where** they affect a compared figure — verify against the `.BAS` source in Appendix C.
- [ ] Unit handling: calc runs in the original **Imperial** units; conversion is a presentation layer applied at the boundary only (`units.py`). No SI constants leak into calc.
- [ ] Deliverable units: any new export/report path renders in the **user-selected** unit system (project field / CLI `--units`, default Imperial), states that system in-band, converts the `-ULT` marker with it, and leaves KEAS/altitude unconverted — `00_program_overview.md`, *Deliverable units follow the user's selection*. A deliverable hard-coded to Imperial is a finding.
- [ ] Both worked examples are checked where applicable: Appendix A (6-place GA single, p131) and Appendix B (10-place twin turboprop, p251).
- [ ] **Every oracle cell states its provenance** — *transcription*, *OCR extraction*, *absent — not printed*, *absent — illegible*, or *back-solved* (`00_theory_sources.md` §Oracle provenance, **P-1**). A page is never recorded as unusable on the strength of its text layer: render it and look. A **back-solved** value is **disqualified** as the oracle for anything downstream of what it was solved from — it cannot disagree with the thing that produced it (#137: a fixture weight back-solved from a mis-OCR'd cell, then used to check that cell).
- [ ] **No gate re-derives the rule it checks** (**P-2**, promoted from design note 39's G-AP-2: *two copies of one rule cannot disagree*). The comparison must be against something that does not share the code's derivation — a printed figure, a transcription made independently of the code, an external solver, or a physical invariant the code nowhere encodes. A gate that applies the rule under test before comparing is agreeing with the code, not testing it (#139: the rotational gate moved the load from the tyre to the axle *inside the test*, and booked the 12 % it was worth as a difference of convention).

### Step 4 — Porting-contract conformance

- [ ] **Pure calc, no I/O.** The module exposes `run(project: Project) -> ModuleResult` and does no file/Streamlit access.
- [ ] **No recomputation of another module's quantity.** Upstream values (weights, CG, geometry, speeds, aero coefficients) are read from the `Project` slice, not recomputed.
- [ ] **Reuses result types.** Emits `LoadValue`/`ConditionResult`/`ModuleResult` so `report.py`, `units.py`, and the CSV writer work unchanged. The CSV stays "one row per load case" via `load_cases_to_rows` — generalised, not reinvented per module.
- [ ] **Self-registers** at import (`register("name", run)`) and is imported in `sloads/modules/__init__.py`.
- [ ] **Missing-slice behaviour:** the module raises `ValueError` when its input slice is absent (so `run_all_modules` skips it cleanly).

### Step 5 — Preserved engineering conventions

- [ ] Sign conventions match the original (e.g. engine-mount reaction torque reported **negative**; "clockwise from the pilot's view is positive" for rotor RPM and stoppage torque).
- [ ] Any new convention introduced by the module is recorded in `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` / `PROGRAM_SPEC.md`.

### Step 6 — Error handling & robustness

- [ ] Optional inputs (blank fields that the BASIC approximated from geometry) are handled, not assumed present.
- [ ] No silent `nan`/`None` propagation into a reported load value without an explicit reason.
- [ ] Multi-engine / twin inputs (Appendix B) are handled where the module supports them.

### Step 7 — Code quality

- [ ] `ruff check sloads/ cli.py oracle.py app_shell/ oracle_app/ scripts/` is clean (single-letter structural names are allowed via the `E741` ignore — do not work around the linter with noqa for other rules without justification; every `noqa` carries a reason).
- [ ] `mypy` is clean, and no new `# type: ignore` / `Any` widening / `cast` was added to pass it (`00_program_overview.md` §Static typing & lint).
- [ ] New domain terms (program names, variables) are added to `cspell.json`.
- [ ] Public functions in `sloads/` have type hints and a one-line docstring.
- [ ] No magic numbers — load factors, tolerances, and unit factors are named constants.

### Step 8 — Test coverage

- [ ] One manual-example test per module, asserting `run(project)` against the Appendix A and/or B figures.
- [ ] Happy path **and** at least one edge case (missing optional input, twin layout, zero rotor speed, etc.).
- [ ] `pytest` passes with no failures; report pass/fail in the review.

| Severity | Label | Criteria | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | `[CRITICAL]` | Wrong load value, un-cited equation, lost sign convention | Block merge — must fix |

---

## 5. Common defect patterns

| Pattern | Where to look | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `3.1416` or other hard-coded constant instead of `constants.py` / `math.pi` | the module | Drift vs the tolerance oracle; defeats the modernize-the-math decision |
| BASIC `int(x*1000)/1000` truncation dropped (or added where it doesn't belong) | the module vs Appendix C `.BAS` | Compared figure off in the last places |
| Sign convention flipped (reaction torque, rotor direction) | the module | Sign-wrong load fed downstream |
| Recomputing weight/CG/geometry instead of reading the `Project` slice | the module | Two sources of truth diverge |
| Exact `==` used where a tolerance oracle is required (or vice-versa) | `tests/test_<module>.py` | Brittle or false-passing test |
| SI constant used inside calc | the module / `units.py` | Calc no longer matches the Imperial manual |
| Export/report hard-coded to Imperial, or a bundle with files in two systems | the export/report path / `units.py` | Ignores the user's selection; a BDF and a report in different systems mis-size structure with nothing on the page to show it |
| Converted load whose `-ULT` marker still reads `lbs`/`ft-lb` in SI | `units.py` / the renderer | Basis and magnitude disagree at the point of use |
| Module doesn't `register()` or isn't imported in `modules/__init__.py` | `sloads/modules/__init__.py` | Module invisible to registry/CLI/GUI |
| Docs not updated; backlog item left in place after completion | `docs/` | Documentation drift; violates `CLAUDE.md` |

## 6. Review output format

```
[SEVERITY] file.py:line — Short description.
WHY: The defect or risk, in one sentence.
FIX: Concrete suggestion (snippet if helpful).
```

Example:

```
[CRITICAL] sloads/modules/engine.py:212 — Reaction torque returned positive.
WHY: The suite reports engine-mount reaction torque negative; a positive sign
     reverses the load direction fed to the mount-structure check.
FIX: Negate at the LoadValue boundary and add a test asserting torque < 0 for
     the Appendix A case (p131).
```

## 7. Final approval gate

A change may be approved **only** when:

- [ ] All `[CRITICAL]` and `[MAJOR]` items are resolved or explicitly justified.
- [ ] `pytest` passes; the module's Appendix A/B assertions pass within ±0.1%.
- [ ] `ruff check sloads/ cli.py oracle.py app_shell/ oracle_app/ scripts/` and `mypy` are clean.
- [ ] The closure tier (`CLAUDE.md` S/M/L table) is complete for every item the change closes.
