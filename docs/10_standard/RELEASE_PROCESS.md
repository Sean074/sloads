# Release Process — sloads

Authoritative guide for versioning, validating, and releasing the suite.

---

## 1. Version numbering

Semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

| Component | When to increment |
|---|---|
| `MAJOR` | Breaking change to the `project.json` schema or the load-case CSV shape |
| `MINOR` | A new module ported (a new suite program runs), or a new GUI/CLI capability |
| `PATCH` | Bug fix that does not change the public interface |

The version lives in **`sloads/_version.py`** under `__version__`, and nowhere
else: `pyproject.toml` declares `dynamic = ["version"]` and reads that attribute,
and the report generator's provenance stamp reads it too (guard:
`tests/test_version_owner.py`). It moved there on 2026-08-30 because the stamp
used to ask `importlib.metadata`, which reads install-time `PKG-INFO` — so after
the 0.8.1 bump every report stamped 0.8.0 until somebody reinstalled. The
`project.json`
schema has its own `SCHEMA_VERSION` (in `sloads/models/project.py`) — bump it
when the input schema changes, and ensure `io.py` still loads older saves.

Pre-release tags: `0.2.0-beta.1` for candidates shared externally.

## 2. What constitutes a release

**Cadence rule (2026-08-05, process review R3): release small and often.** Cut a release
whenever the §3 gate passes and any of the following is true:

- **~2–3 weeks have passed since the last tag, or ~5 steps have closed** — whichever
  comes first. Accumulated small improvements are a valid release; do not wait for a
  phase milestone. Never let `[Unreleased]` grow past roughly a release-worth of work —
  unreleased work has no regression baseline.
- A critical numerical-fidelity bug is fixed and verified.
- A new module is production-ready and passes its Appendix A/B acceptance test.
- A breaking change to the `project.json` schema or CSV output has been made.

Do **not** cut a release for documentation-only changes or in-progress modules.

## 3. Pre-release checklist

Each item is a hard gate.

### 3.1 Backlog & documentation (bounded — no unbounded drift audit)

Documentation consistency is enforced **per-change** by the tiered closure requirement
in `CLAUDE.md`, not re-audited at release time.

- [ ] [`../30_future/00_backlog.md`](../30_future/00_backlog.md) — every item in this release is removed (**spot-check**, not an audit; closed items don't live in the backlog).
- [ ] [`../40_history/00_completed_development.md`](../40_history/00_completed_development.md) — every tier-M/L step in this release is recorded at its closure-tier depth (tier S has no history entry — its `changes/` fragment is the record).
- [ ] `changes/` — every closed item has its fragment; `.venv/bin/python scripts/build_changelog.py --dry-run` runs clean and reads as the release note (`changes/README.md`).
- [ ] **The band being cut is retired from the priority table** and the band that
      follows becomes the milestone in flight (§Where things stand says so). A band
      left in the table naming a released version is caught by
      `tests/test_backlog_issues.py::test_no_open_row_sits_in_a_band_whose_release_is_already_cut`
      — it was missed at the 0.7.2 cut, which is why the assertion exists.
- [ ] `.venv/bin/python scripts/branch_protection_snapshot.py --check` — the live
      protection on `main` still matches `.github/branch-protection.json`, which the
      process docs are asserted against. **This is the one comparison CI cannot make**
      (the test job has no `gh` auth), and the cut is when it matters: the 0.7.2
      milestone PR was refused at exactly this point by a linear-history rule three
      documents denied (issue #46, CR-D-4).

### 3.2 Code quality
- [ ] No open `[CRITICAL]`/`[MAJOR]` findings from the latest review (see [`CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`](CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md)).
- [ ] `ruff check sloads/ cli.py oracle.py app/ app_shell/ oracle_app/ scripts/` and `mypy` are clean.

### 3.3 Test suite
- [ ] `pytest` passes — zero failures, zero errors.
- [ ] No `skip`/`xfail` without a reason logged in the backlog.

### 3.4 Numerical acceptance (the oracle)
- [ ] Every ported module's `tests/test_<module>.py` passes against its Appendix A and/or B figures within **±0.1%** (`rel_tol=1e-3`); integer/dimensionless quantities exact.
- [ ] For releases that touch a shared upstream module (weights, geometry, aero), re-run the **full** suite — downstream modules read those slices.

### 3.5 GUI / CLI smoke test
- [ ] `scripts/smoke_test.sh` exits 0 — it starts **both** GUI entry points headless and checks each root page renders (HTTP 200, no traceback in the server log): `app/Home.py`, and `oracle_app/Oracle.py` through the `sloads-oracle` console script (the launcher is run, not path-checked). It then runs `sloads engine examples/ga6_normal.project.json -o out.csv` and checks the CSV.
- [ ] Two front-ends, two boots: the entry points named here and the ones the script boots are compared by `tests/test_ci_conformance.py` — a GUI this gate never starts is a GUI no release gate starts (#127, 2026-08-28).
- [ ] **The boot gate proves boot, not use.** `tests/test_gui_journey.py` is the second line and runs in the ordinary (fast) CI gate, so it is green before the cut rather than checked at it: every bundled example loaded, every `workflow.py` step visited in order, one no-op interaction with every editable block, every module run — and the project asserted unchanged across the whole walk, because nothing was entered. The defects that motivated it were two and three pages downstream of an interaction, where no boot check reaches (#145, 2026-08-29). Its `KNOWN_OPEN` list is the standing set of accepted no-op-Apply writes; each entry has a backlog row, and the file fails if one stops reproducing.
- [ ] **Walk it by hand once.** Load one bundled example in `app/Home.py`, move through the sidebar top to bottom, and open Results Review and Export at the end. The automated journey drives widgets, not a browser; this is the line that sees a page render wrong rather than raise.

## 4. Cutting the release

**Who and where (design note 28 MD-11):** the **release manager** named on the
milestone cuts the release on a `release/x.y.z` branch — steps 1–3 below are one PR,
reviewed like any other; the tag (step 4) is made on `main` after it merges. The
role rotates.

**Working alone (`DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0, 2026-08-22): there is no
`release/x.y.z` branch.** The milestone branch `dev/vX.Y.Z` *is* the release
branch — it has carried every item of the release, so cutting on a second
branch would only move the same commits again. Steps 1–3 below are commits on
`dev/vX.Y.Z` (they are docs, `pyproject.toml` and generated history, so the
gate scales accordingly); then open **one** pull request into `main` and
**rebase-merge** it (`gh pr merge <N> --rebase`), so every per-item commit
survives on `main` and `git log` stays the step-per-commit record. **Never
squash:** that collapses the whole milestone into one commit, which is the
record this model exists to keep. Rebase — not a merge commit — because `main`
enforces **linear history**: a merge commit is refused outright ("This branch
must not contain merge commits", found at the 0.7.2 cut, 2026-08-25, where this
paragraph had said *merge commit* since 2026-08-22 and the setting had said
otherwise all along). Rebase satisfies both: linear history for the protection
rule, one commit per item for the record. It rewrites the branch's SHAs onto
`main`'s tip, so delete `dev/vX.Y.Z` after the merge rather than reusing it, and
it drops any merge commit the branch itself picked up. That push to `main` runs the full
3.10/3.11 + coverage matrix — the gate of record for the whole milestone. Step 4
tags `main` after the merge, unchanged. The issues of this milestone are
already closed, each in its own commit, so the PR body carries **no**
`Closes #N`.

1. **Bump the version** in `sloads/_version.py` (`__version__`). `pyproject.toml` reads it and needs no edit. Commit: `Bump version to X.Y.Z`.
2. **Build the changelog and roll the history fragments** — `.venv/bin/python scripts/build_changelog.py X.Y.Z --date YYYY-MM-DD` assembles the `changes/` fragments into `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` (Breaking / Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed), inserts every `changes/*.history.md` entry at the top of `docs/40_history/00_completed_development.md` (design note 28 MD-4), opens a fresh empty `[Unreleased]`, and deletes the consumed fragments. Then write the release-cut block in the history file by hand (the one entry that is not a fragment). Run `scripts/backlog_issues.py check` — every priority-table row names an open issue and vice versa (MD-5). Never hand-edit `[Unreleased]`; fix a fragment and re-run instead. Commit: `Changelog for X.Y.Z`.
3. **Roll the history (mechanical, bounded — design note 26, 2026-08-16):**
   - move every plan/design note in `docs/30_future/` whose status header reads *shipped* to `docs/40_history/` (next free number; update its `docs/00_INDEX.md` row);
   - if [`../40_history/00_completed_development.md`](../40_history/00_completed_development.md) exceeds **1,500 lines** (`tests/test_changelog_fragments.py` warns), cut it at the *previous* release's "Release cut" block and move everything below that block verbatim into a new frozen `docs/40_history/NN_completed_development_to_<prev>.md` (header text: copy `11_completed_development_to_0.5.0.md`); the live file keeps this release's cycle plus its own release-cut block; add the INDEX row and the pointer line in the live file's header.
   Nothing here is an audit: statuses and line counts are the only inputs.
4. **Tag:** `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"` then `git push origin vX.Y.Z`. Create a GitHub Release from the tag with the changelog entry as the body.
5. **Archive verification** — record the numerical output (module figure vs. Appendix figure) for the modules in this release under `docs/40_history/` as a permanent regression baseline.

---

## 5. Post-release
- [ ] `docs/30_future/00_backlog.md` — remove anything resolved by this release; add any new defects found in final testing.
- [ ] Confirm the release tag/date are noted in `docs/40_history/00_completed_development.md` (a "Release cut" block, tier M depth — it is also the next history-roll's cut line).
- [ ] Identify the next phase/module from the backlog.

---

## 6. Hotfix process

A hotfix is a `PATCH` release correcting a critical defect in a released version.

1. Branch from the release tag: `git checkout -b hotfix/vX.Y.Z+1 vX.Y.Z`.
2. Apply the minimal fix — **no new modules, no refactoring**.
3. Run the pre-release checklist (§3), focused on the affected module + any downstream readers.
4. Bump to `X.Y.Z+1`, date the changelog, tag, release.
5. Merge back to `main`; record the resolved defect under "Resolved defects" in the history.

**With a milestone branch open (`DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0):** this is the only
path that puts a commit on `main` mid-milestone, so it is also the only time
`dev/vX.Y.Z` has to take `main` back — do it immediately after step 5
(`git checkout dev/vX.Y.Z && git rebase main`), before the next item, and
re-check the three shared counters of §6 (`SCHEMA_VERSION`, the Imperial
digest, case-ID bands) since that replay is exactly where they can collide.
**Rebase, not `git merge main`** (corrected 2026-08-25): a merge commit on the
milestone branch is what makes the milestone PR unmergeable at the cut under
`main`'s linear-history rule, and nothing surfaces it until then.
A defect found mid-milestone in *unreleased* work is **not** a hotfix — it is
the next item on the milestone branch.
