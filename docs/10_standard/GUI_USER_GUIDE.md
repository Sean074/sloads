# GUI User Guide

A short, task-oriented guide to driving the loads suite through its Streamlit
GUI: the workflow phases, what you enter on each page, how one page *seeds* the
next, how to read the results (especially **what basis the loads are on**), and one
end-to-end walkthrough of the bundled `ga6_normal` example with hand-checkable
numbers.

> **Naming note.** This guide is written brand-neutral and refers to "the app"
> or "the suite." A planned rename (backlog M3-1) will settle the product name,
> CLI command, and import package; when it lands, the few command examples here
> get a find/replace pass. Nothing about the workflow below changes.

For the *why* behind the design, see
[`GUI_design.md`](GUI_design.md) (navigation model, page anatomy, the
unit-boundary input pattern). For every input field's type/units/default, see
the generated [`DATA_DICTIONARY.md`](DATA_DICTIONARY.md).

> **The original-suite-only interface.** A second front-end, the **oracle GUI**
> (`streamlit run oracle_app/Oracle.py` / `sloads-oracle`), exposes exactly the
> original FAR 23 LOADS suite's input set — no concept mode, plots or exports —
> over the same project file. It has its own page-by-page illustrated guide:
> [`docs/60_guide/00_index.md`](../60_guide/00_index.md). Projects move between
> the two front-ends unchanged.

## 1. What the tool computes

The suite computes the structural **design loads** a small aircraft must sustain
under **14 CFR Part 23, Subpart C** (flight, control-surface, ground, and
engine-mount loads). It is a modern replication of the FAR23 LOADS programs, and
in **concept mode** it generalizes beyond the GA caps to size an early-concept
airframe and hand its per-component loads to a downstream structural tool.

You build up **one project** (`project.json`) page by page. Each page owns a
slice of the input, runs its calculation, and stores results back into the same
project — so the whole airplane travels as a single reloadable file.

### The one rule to internalize first: sloads gives you LIMIT loads

- **LIMIT load** — the highest load expected in service. This is what sloads
  computes and what it gives you (it is also what the manual's oracle figures
  are, which is why you can check the numbers against them directly).
- **ULTIMATE load** — limit × a **factor of safety** (default **1.5**, per
  14 CFR 23.303). This is what structure is actually sized to.

**Every load sloads delivers is LIMIT, and it is your sizing analysis that
applies the factor.** The load-case CSV, the exported sizing cards, the reports
and the Review/Export pages all report limit loads with the factor **stated** —
in an `SF` column, or an `SF=` line on a deck's subcase — and applied nowhere.
Multiply by the stated `SF` to size.

Units are therefore plain (`lbs`, `ft-lb`, `N`, `Nm`). The `-ULT` marker means
one specific thing: **this load is already ultimate — apply nothing further.** It
appears on only two conditions, which 14 CFR prescribes as ultimate outright:

| You see | It means |
|---|---|
| `lbs-ULT`, `N-ULT` | a force that is **already ultimate** |
| `ft-lb-ULT`, `Nm-ULT`, `lb-in-ULT` | a moment / torque that is **already ultimate** |
| `psi-ULT`, `lb/in^2-ULT` | a design pressure that is **already ultimate** |
| plain `lbs`, `ft-lb`, `in`, `deg`, `kt` | a **limit** load, *or* a non-load quantity (geometry, weight, speed, load factor) |
| `SF=1.5` | the factor **you** apply to that case to reach ultimate |
| `SF=1.0` | nothing to apply — the case is already ultimate |
| `SF=N/A` | not a load case at all, so no factor is prescribed |

**Every page shows LIMIT, and so does every export.** There is no longer a
LIMIT-vs-ULTIMATE distinction between the analysis pages and the deliverables:
the per-module pages, the downloads, the reports and the sbeam decks are all on
one basis, which is what lets you check any number against the manual's figures.
A deck states, on each subcase, the factor it did not apply, so a solver operator
cannot mistake what they have been handed.

> The factor is prescribed for **loads only** — forces, moments and pressures.
> Weights, inertias, areas, speeds, angles and the dimensionless load factors *n*
> take no factor at all. A load factor is a limit quantity; multiplying one by
> 1.5 is an error, not a conservatism.

## 2. The workflow: phases and pages

The left sidebar is built from the workflow graph, so page order is the analysis
order. There are seven phases:

This table is **derived from `sloads/workflow.py`** — the navigation SSOT — and
held to it by `tests/test_page_links.py::test_the_gui_guide_phase_table_matches_the_workflow`.
Edit the graph, not the table.

| Phase | Pages | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Start** | Project Dashboard · Project JSON Editor | Load/save a project; see completeness. |
| **Develop V-n diagram** | Geometry · Weight & Mass Properties · Aerodynamic Data · Structural Speeds · Flight Envelope (V-n) | Define the airplane and build its flight envelope. |
| **Flight loads** | Wing Loads · Fuselage Loads · Tail Loads · Tail Span Loads · Balanced Cases | Distribute the balanced flight loads onto the structure — including the two pages that carry the primary distributed deliverable. |
| **Other loads** | Aileron Loads · Flap Loads · Tab Loads · Engine Mount Loads · One Engine Out | Control-surface and engine-mount loads. |
| **Landing loads** | Landing Loads | Ground/landing gear loads. |
| **Load-case plotting** | Loads Plots | Visualize the envelope and load cases. |
| **Export** | Aircraft Comparison · Results Review · Export & Report | Compare configurations, consolidate and export the ultimate deliverables. |

**The Dashboard is your map.** It shows which slices are present and which pages
are ready to run (a page is "ready" once the slices it *requires* exist). Work
top-to-bottom and the requirements fall into place.

## 3. The seed chain (why order matters)

The suite is **single-source**: a quantity is entered on exactly one page and
every downstream page reads it read-only. You will see fields shown greyed-out /
read-only on later pages — that is deliberate, not a bug. The important chains:

- **Geometry is the root.** The wing planform you draw on **Geometry** seeds the
  wing area *S*, mean aerodynamic chord *MAC*, and the 25%-MAC station used by
  the weight envelope, the design speeds, the flight envelope, and the wing/tail
  load distributions. Fuselage and empennage geometry (including elevator/rudder)
  are also entered here once.
- **Maximum lift coefficient is entered once**, on **Aerodynamic Data**
  (`clmax_clean` / `clmax_flap`). Stall speeds *VS*/*VSF* are *derived* from it —
  you never type a stall speed.
- **Design speeds and limit load factors** come from **Structural Speeds**
  (STRSPEED). The **Flight Envelope**, aileron, flap, and tab pages all read
  *VA/VC/VD/VF* from there.
- **Weight/CG cases** are entered once on the weight pages and flow into the
  flight-envelope balancing.

Practical consequence: **do Geometry → Weight → Aerodynamic Data → Structural
Speeds → Flight Envelope in that order.** After that, the Flight/Other/Landing
pages can be run in any order.

---

## 4. What to enter where

A compact tour. Field-level detail (type, units, default, owning page) is in
[`DATA_DICTIONARY.md`](DATA_DICTIONARY.md); this is the orientation.

**Geometry.** The wing (and other lifting-surface) planforms as leading/trailing
edge point lists, the parametric fuselage/wing/tail/gear layout, the fuselage
station-area outline, and the single-source empennage (h-tail + v-tail +
elevator + rudder). Everything geometric starts here.

**Weight & Mass Properties.** The mission inputs for the statistical weight
estimate (seats, crew, power, hours, baggage), the itemized mass database
(each item's weight and station), the structural CG-envelope limits (percent
MAC), and the named weight/CG loading cases.

**Aerodynamic Data.** The airplane-less-tail aero-coefficient polynomials
(cruise and, optionally, flaps-down), the maximum lift coefficients, and the
per-surface spanwise airload inputs (section lift slope, twist).

**Structural Speeds.** The category (**N/U/A** for FAR 23, or **C** for
concept), design weight, sea-level max speed *VH*, and your chosen *VA/VC/VD/VF*
(each verified against — and raised to — its FAR minimum). Optional Subpart-G
placard targets (VNE/VNO/VFE) are advisory only.

**Flight Envelope (V-n).** The tail center-of-pressure stations, reference Mach,
and the altitude list. Runs FLTLOADS: builds the V-n diagram and the balancing
tail loads at every CG case and altitude.

**Flight-loads pages (Wing / Fuselage / Tail).** The mass distributions and
critical conditions that turn the envelope into distributed structural loads.

**Other-loads pages (Aileron / Flap / Tab / Engine Mount / One Engine Out).**
Each control surface's own geometry and deflection limits; the engine-mount
page takes the engine/propeller weights, CG, power/torque, and rotor data.

**Landing Loads.** Gear geometry (axle positions, strut stroke, tire/hub sizes)
and the landing load factor.

**Export & Report.** Writes the ultimate load-case CSV and the structural-sizing
cards, with a methods/limitations statement stamped in. Its **Summary report**
section renders the controlling document of the whole deliverable — the airplane,
its envelope figures, the FAR coverage matrix, and every governing ultimate load
with the safety factor and station it acts at. The LaTeX `.tex` always downloads;
press **Compile PDF** to typeset it here when a TeX engine (`tectonic`,
`latexmk` or `pdflatex`) is installed. Both, plus `METHODS.txt` and every CSV/BDF,
go in the bundle `.zip`. Headless, the same document comes from
`python cli.py --report out.pdf project.json`.

---

## 5. Reading the results

Every module renders results as **load cases** — one row per structural
condition — with labelled outputs. On any consolidated or exported view:

1. **Check the units string** for `-ULT`. If it is there, the number is
   ultimate and ready for sizing. If a page shows a plain unit, confirm the page
   is a per-module *analysis* page (captioned `LIMIT`) — do not export those
   numbers as-is.
2. **Read the `SF` marker.** `SF=1.5` is the default. `SF=1.0` means the value
   is *already* ultimate (or an inherently-ultimate quantity) — it is still an
   ultimate deliverable, not a limit load.
3. **Load factors, speeds, angles, weights** have no `-ULT` — they are
   dimensionless or non-load and are reported directly.

---

## 6. End-to-end walkthrough: `ga6_normal`

The bundled `examples/ga6_normal.project.json` is the manual's **Appendix A**
airplane — a 6-place GA single (the Cessna-210-class example McMaster works
through). Loading it and stepping the pages reproduces the manual's printed
figures. Below are **four hand-checkable numbers** that trace the seed chain
from weight through to the flight envelope; each is a currently-passing
regression oracle (see
[`../40_history/01_verification_baseline_0.2.0.md`](../40_history/01_verification_baseline_0.2.0.md)
for the full table and page citations).

**Load it:**

```bash
# GUI
.venv/bin/streamlit run app/Home.py      # then Start → Project JSON Editor → load examples/ga6_normal.project.json

# or one module from the CLI
.venv/bin/python cli.py engine examples/ga6_normal.project.json
```

**Checkpoint 1 — Weight & Mass Properties (WTESTIMA).**
Max take-off weight = **3468 lb**, empty weight = **2150 lb**, empty/take-off
ratio = **0.62**. *(Manual Appendix A p133.)*

**Checkpoint 2 — Weight & Mass Properties (WTONECG, aft-gross loading).**
CG fuselage station XBAR = **84.99936 in**; pitch inertia IYY =
**2058.209 slug-ft²**. *(Appendix A p136.)* These are geometry/inertia — note
**no `-ULT`**.

**Checkpoint 3 — Structural Speeds (STRSPEED).**
Limit positive load factor *n₊* = **3.8**, limit negative *n₋* = **−1.52**;
maneuver speed VA = **121.3 KEAS**, cruise VC = **170 KEAS**, dive VD =
**212.5 KEAS**. The load factor is dimensionless; the speeds are KEAS — again no
`-ULT`. *(Appendix A V-n table.)*

**Checkpoint 4 — Flight Envelope (FLTLOADS), CG1 aft-gross.**
The **MAN A** corner (positive maneuver at VA) balances to
**V = 121.3 KEAS, NZ = 3.80, α = 12.75°** — VA and *n₊* from Checkpoints 3
carried straight into the envelope corner, confirming the seed chain end-to-end.
*(Appendix A p179–180.)*

If those four match on your machine, the input path is wired correctly. The
**Export** phase then applies the ×1.5 factor of safety at the boundary, so the
same 3.80-g maneuver appears in the exported CSV as an **ultimate** case
(`SF=1.5`, loads in `lbs-ULT` / `ft-lb-ULT`).

> Because the math is modernized (real `math.pi`, not the BASIC's `3.1416`), the
> manual's printed figures are **±0.1% regression oracles**, not exact — the
> suite asserts `math.isclose(..., rel_tol=1e-3)` against them.

## 7. Concept mode & caveats

Set the Structural Speeds **category to `C`** to enter concept mode: the GA-only
caps (the 23.337 maneuver-load-factor limit, the 12,500-lb / GA-seat limits) are
bypassed, you provide explicit design load factors, and the statistical weight
estimate becomes a sanity figure rather than the source of truth (weights come
straight from the itemized mass database). Concept mode is a **superset** — on
GA inputs it reduces exactly to the oracle-locked FAR 23 path.

**Dive-speed basis (concept only).** In category `C` the Design Speeds tab adds a
**Dive speed basis** choice, because 14 CFR 25.335(b) offers two routes and the
regulation joins them with an *or*:

- **Speed ratio (VD ≥ 1.25·VC)** — the default, and what the suite has always
  done. `VC/MC ≤ 0.8·VD/MD` is the same statement written the other way round.
- **Mach margin (MD ≥ MC + margin)** — your chosen VD is honoured as long as MD
  clears MC by the margin, and raised to meet it if not. Needs a shoulder
  altitude and a chosen VD. Use this when the ratio route would force a dive
  speed your configuration does not have (a regional jet at VC 310 kt is pushed
  to VD 387.5 kt by the ratio, MD 0.94 — a margin of +0.19, which no transport
  designs to).

The margin defaults to **0.07 M**. Entering less than that requires a written
**rational-analysis basis** and raises a standing warning: reducing below 0.07 M
needs significant justification — a rational analysis crediting automatic systems
(25.335(b)(2)) — and **represents a certification risk**. **0.05 M is an absolute
floor** the form will not go below. Whichever route you pick, the results state
that only the (b)(2) Mach term is evaluated: 25.335(b) wants the *greater of*
that margin and the (b)(1) upset criterion, which this suite does not compute, so
a clean margin here is not a compliance demonstration.

An optional **rough-air speed VB** (25.335(d)) can be entered; it is checked for
ordering against VC and never changes a design speed or a load.

Some concept-mode results carry caveats the UI surfaces (e.g. the fuselage
body-load moment-closure note, and the fixed body-rate stand-in for the 25.371
gyro case). The Export deliverables stamp a methods/limitations statement so a
downstream sizing tool inherits the same caveats. Read them before trusting an
out-of-band result.

## 8. Bundled examples

Load any of these from **Start → Project JSON Editor** (or `New from example`):

| Example | Category | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| `ga6_normal` | FAR 23 Normal (Appendix A) | full workflow, all six phases |
| `cessna_210` | FAR 23 Normal | full workflow |
| `concept_regional_jet` | concept jet (T-tail, Part 25 supplement on, **25.335(b) Mach-margin dive speed**) | full workflow |
| `dhc8_dash8` | concept twin-turboprop (one-engine-out) | full workflow |
| `atr42_100` | concept twin-turboprop (one-engine-out) | full workflow |
| `concept_heavy` | **minimal concept core** | V-n → Flight Envelope only |

`concept_heavy` is deliberately minimal — it carries just the weight / geometry /
speeds / aero / flight-loads / wing-mass core to demonstrate the concept V-n
path, and has no engine, control-surface, fuselage-mass or landing data, so it
stops cleanly at the Flight Envelope rather than running the downstream loads
pages. The other five are authored to run end-to-end without a red error.
