# 2. Weight & Mass Properties

*Original program(s):* `WTESTIMA+WTONECG+WTENV`.

## What this page is for

Three of the original programs share this page because they share one
subject: what the airplane weighs and where that weight is. `WTESTIMA` makes
a statistical first estimate of empty weight from top-level facts (seats,
horsepower, engines). `WTONECG` sums an itemized weight database into total
weight, CG and moments of inertia. `WTENV` builds the structural CG envelope
— the weight-vs-CG boundary the load analyses are run at. Everything mass
that any later page uses — the wing inertia relief, the fuselage mass
distribution, the landing CG cases, the one-engine-out yaw inertia — reads
from what you enter here.

## Before this page

Nothing upstream is required to start entering data, though the CG results
mean more once [Geometry](01_configuration_layout.md) exists (the envelope is
stated in % MAC, and the MAC comes from your wing). Have the weight
statement or equipment list, the certified design weights and the CG limits
on your desk.

## The inputs

The generated field table for this page:
[`_generated/weight_mass.md`](_generated/weight_mass.md).

**Design weights.** Max takeoff weight and max landing weight — the two
certified weights the load analyses hang from. They must respect the chain
*empty ≤ MLW ≤ MTOW ≤ everything in the database*: you must be able to land
with reserves, and you cannot weigh more than everything you have. The page
warns when the chain breaks.

**Weight estimate.** `WTESTIMA`'s inputs: an airplane description, engine
count and continuous horsepower, seats, crew, cruise hours, baggage,
pressurisation, and the engine-weight class code. The estimate it produces
is **advisory** — shown beside your entered empty weight with the difference
— and nothing downstream computes with it. Use it as a plausibility check on
the database you enter next, or as a starting point when you have no weight
statement yet.

**Weight items — the database.** One row per mass item: name, weight, and
its (x, y, z) position in inches, with optional moments of inertia for the
items big enough to carry their own (engines, wing). Three kinds sort the
loading hierarchy: **empty** (the airframe), **minimum** (aboard for any
flight — unusable fuel, oil), **discretionary** (payload and fuel you choose
to load). A **consumable** row can burn down to a fraction; the **component**
tag (wing / fuselage / h-tail / v-tail) states which structure reacts the
weight — it is explicit because most rows sit on the centreline and no
geometry can infer that an engine hangs on the wing. This database is the
single source of truth for mass: every later mass quantity is derived from
it.

**CG envelope.** `WTENV`'s corner data: gross weight, the forward and aft
gross limits in % MAC, and the "forward regardless" light-weight corner with
its weight. The certified limits arrive in inches; the page shows the
conversion through your wing's MAC.

**Weight & CG cases.** The discrete loading points the analyses run at.
Flight-tagged cases are the CG points `FLTLOADS` balances at; ground-tagged
cases are the three roled landing loadings (`aft max landing`,
`fwd max landing`, `fwd light`) that `LANDLOAD` requires. A case can simply
state weight and CG, or it can **state its loading** — which discretionary
rows are aboard and how full each consumable is — and let the page check
that the stated weight and CG are what that loading actually sums to.

**The loading, on the case.** Open a case's row: below its scalars sits
its loading. A case without one offers **Add loading**, which enters the
loading the search found for it — the same rows, the same weight and CG,
so nothing moves until you change it. Then the rows aboard are a
multiselect over the discretionary items, every row that may be partial
(a tank aboard, a named hold) gets a fraction with `1` meaning whole, and
**Add ballast** puts a real ballast row on the case with its own station
and waterline. The caption under the block is the check: what the loading
sums to, and whether the entered weight and CG agree with it — the loading
is authoritative, the scalars are its echo. On a concept-category
airplane a flight case that still runs on the search is named at the top
of the page until its loading is entered.

**Wing weight for SELECT.** The wing structural weight the selection program
subtracts as inertia relief; enter the same wing weight your database
carries.

**Tail surface mass.** An optional per-surface override of the empennage
mass that is otherwise derived from the component-tagged database rows.

## Worked example — single (`ga6_normal`)

The database is Appendix A's own loading list, row for row: airframe
components (wing, tails, gear, engine install, propeller, fuselage
structure), then the manual's loading sequence — pilot, copilot, third
through sixth person, 30-minute fuel, fuel to gross weight, and the ballast
row the book itself carries. Gross weight 3,400 lb, MLW 3,230 lb; envelope
20–31 % MAC at gross with the forward-regardless corner at 13 % MAC / 2,800
lb. Four flight CG cases (`CG1`…`CG4`) reproduce the book's balance points,
and the three roled ground cases sit at the landing corners. With these rows
the page's computed weight and CG reproduce the book's — the printed case
this suite is oracle-locked against.

## Worked example — twin (`baron_58`)

The design weights and every arm are the type certificate's: MTOW 5,500 lb,
MLW 5,400 lb, seats at stations 75/117/150, fuel at 82, nose baggage at 15.
The empty-weight **split** is a marked estimate (the certificate publishes
the total, 4,010 lb, not the breakdown), with the engines and propellers on
wing rows at the estimated nacelle butt line ±66 in so the wing carries
them. The envelope corners are the certificate's station limits
(+78.3…+86.0 at gross, +74.0 forward at light weight) converted through the
constructed MAC. Each ground case **states its loading**: aft max landing
is mid+aft passengers with most of the fuel; fwd max landing is front seats,
nose baggage and fuel; fwd light is two front occupants only — three
loadings the database genuinely produces, all inside the certified
envelope. Sources and estimate markings:
[`examples/baron_58.sources.md`](../../examples/baron_58.sources.md).

## Results on this page

Three blocks, none of them loads (no LIMIT/ULTIMATE, no safety factors):
the **advisory estimate** beside your entered weights with the delta; the
**mass properties** of the itemized loading — total weight, CG position,
and the moments of inertia `WTONECG` computed; and the **CG envelope** as
`WTENV` built it. Under the cases themselves, the **Mass cases** table:
one row per case with its entered weight and CG, what its loading sums to
and whether the two agree, the fuel, payload and ballast aboard, the wing
panel and point masses the wing analysis will hang for it, and where the
loading came from — entered on the case, found by the search, or the
whole database when the search fails, with the reason. Sanity checks: computed empty weight and CG against the
weight statement; the all-aboard total against MTOW (it should exceed it —
you choose what to leave behind); inertias within the ballpark of published
values for the class; and the page's consistency warnings — a loading CG
outside the envelope, a broken weight chain, or wing-tagged mass that the
wing-loads page doesn't carry are each stated in words.

## Common mistakes

- **Treating the estimate as the answer.** `WTESTIMA` is advisory; the
  analyses read the item database. An estimate row seeded into the database
  still needs a real position.
- **Leaving component tags at fuselage.** A wing-mounted engine tagged
  `fuselage` moves its weight to the body beam and deletes the wing's
  inertia relief. Tag every row deliberately.
- **Arms from a different datum** than the geometry page. Same datum
  everywhere, always.
- **Ground cases at envelope corners the database cannot load.** The three
  landing cases are loadings, not aspirations — state the loading, or pick
  weight/CG the rows can actually produce; the page tells you when they
  cannot.
- **Forgetting inertias on the heavy items.** Zeros are accepted, but the
  one-engine-out yaw inertia and the gyroscopic terms are only as good as
  the Izz your database implies.
