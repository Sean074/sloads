# M4-1 — Fuselage body loads: moment closure (design note)

**Closed 2026-08-03.** The shipped record is the M4-1 entry in
[`../90_record/00_completed_development.md`](../90_record/00_completed_development.md); this note is kept
as the design rationale behind it — the diagnosis, the options weighed, the
formula derivation and the per-step verification figures. Reference 1 Ch 15
(p103) is the source procedure.

Two names below are historical: `CLOSURE_CAVEAT` shipped as
`CLOSURE_ARTIFACT_CAVEAT` (it now marks only the fallback path), and the note
was filed under `docs/30_future/` while the work was open.

## The defect

`body_loads` applies a single vertical wing reaction and closes **ΣFz only**.
The Ch 15 procedure reacts the unbalanced moment at the front/rear spar
attachments (and includes the pitching load factor). Verified symptom: terminal
`Myy ≠ 0` — the exported body set carries a net couple.

**Caveat note shipped 2026-07-23** (the M3 pre-release obligation is
discharged): `body_loads.CLOSURE_CAVEAT` is stamped as `$ CAVEAT:` comments in
`fuselage_loads.bdf`, and the Fuselage Loads page + the Export page's Fuselage
row carry the warning. The note comes out when the moment balance lands.

## Diagnosis (2026-08-03)

The residual is the **wing-attachment reaction moment**, not a trim error.
FLTLOADS already closes ΣM_cg for the whole airplane
(`flight_envelope._balance` solves `LT`), so what is open is the **fuselage-only
free body**: the wing lift resultant offset from `xw`, the wing pitching
moment/torque, the wing inertia and the thrust/drag couple are all collapsed
into one point force at 25 % MAC (`body_loads.body_distribution`, the
`wing_reaction = nz*w_fus - lt` line). One vertical force at one station has no
freedom left to satisfy ΣM.

The error is **not uniformly conservative**: bending aft of the wing is offset
by +M_ub, and forward of it the other way.

## Options weighed

| | Option | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| A | The literal Ch 15 two-point spar solve | Adopted as the degenerate case of C |
| B | Self-equilibrated distributed correction (linear or second-order, `∫w dx = 0` and `∫w·x dx = M_ub`) smeared over the **whole** body | **Rejected as primary**; retained as a flagged fallback |
| C | The same self-equilibrated shape restricted to the **wing carry-through** | **Adopted** |
| D | The missing pitching load factor | Split out → **M4-21** |
| E | A distributed (Multhopp/Nelson) body aero moment | Split out → **M4-19** |

**Why B is rejected as the primary method.** The couple physically lives at the
wing box, so smearing it over the whole body relieves wing-region bending and
loads the tail cone with a correction that has no physical source. It closes the
beam while making a known unknown invisible.

**Why neither D nor E substitutes for the closure.** For the balanced trim cases
`θ̈ = 0`, so the pitching load factor (D) contributes nothing there and M4-1
stands on its own. E changes `M_ub` but does not react it.

## Decided approach (2026-08-03) — ship C, with A as its degenerate case

- Reactions at the front/rear spar stations (derived from `geometry.surfaces`
  planform + spar fractions), solved 2×2 from ΣFz = 0 and ΣM = 0:

      R_r = (M_ub + R_total*(L - x_f)) / (x_r - x_f)
      R_f = R_total - R_r

  where `L` is the aft-most station (the reference the terminal moment is taken
  at) — see the **Step 0 verification** below; an earlier draft of this note
  printed `R_total*x_f`, which does not close under this module's integrator.

- Instead of two point loads, distribute `R_total` plus the couple **linearly**
  over `[x_f, x_r]`:

      w(ξ) = 12*M_ub/d^2 * (ξ - 1/2),   ξ = (x - x_f)/d,   d = x_r - x_f

  This is the physically correct support region, degenerates continuously to
  option A as `d → 0`, and avoids A's `±M_ub/d` shear spike over a short
  carry-through — smooth for the beam model, and consistent with how the
  carry-through diffuses load into the frames. Linear is sufficient: a
  second-order shape buys nothing over a short interval with only two
  constraints to satisfy.

  **Provenance of the distributed shape.** This is our engineering choice, *not*
  something p103 sanctions: the manual prescribes two point reactions (option A),
  and its Bruhn Ch A5 pointer is about *beaming the inertia loads to the adjacent
  two frames*, not about diffusing the wing reaction across the carry-through.
  The choice is defensible on the support-region and smoothness grounds above and
  reduces continuously to the manual's own procedure, so it is a refinement
  rather than a deviation — but the calc docstring shall state it as ours.

- **Fallback** (behind an explicit flag) when spar stations are undefined:
  option B, linear over the whole body, `A = 12*M_ub/L^2`. It **SHALL** be
  labelled in output as a *closure artifact*, not as a computed load.

## Acceptance

- Terminal `Myy ≈ 0` and `ΣFz = 0` in the closure suite.
- Front/rear fitting loads emitted (sbeam wants them).
- FAR23 flight oracles unchanged — nothing upstream of `body_loads` changes.
- On close, remove `CLOSURE_CAVEAT` and its three stamp sites: `body_loads.py`,
  the BDF `$ CAVEAT:` comments in `export/sbeam_bridge.py`, and the Fuselage
  Loads + Export Fuselage-row captions.

## Implementation decisions (locked 2026-08-03)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Spar stations from chord fractions on `SurfaceInput`** — `front_spar_pct`/`rear_spar_pct`, resolved in `derived_geometry` as `x = x_LE(root) + pct*c_root` from the wing surface polylines at `y = 0`. | Geometry stays single-sourced (the M2-6 rule); no second editable copy of wing geometry on the body slice. |
| 2 | **Defaults 0.15 / 0.65 `c_root`, flagged as *assumed*.** | Every existing project (incl. `ga6_normal` and the fixtures) closes on the primary path, so the caveat comes off for existing work. The provenance flag (`assumed` vs `entered`) is stated in the BDF header, the GUI and the report, so an assumed spar location is never mistaken for input. |
| 3 | **`R_f`/`R_r` are reported, not applied** — carried on `BodyLoadResult`, shown in the GUI, exported as their own ULTIMATE fitting-loads CSV. | The distributed carry-through set already carries `R_total` *and* the couple; adding the fittings to the FORCE set would double-count and break the `ΣFz = 0` property of the deliverable. |
| 4 | **Station-derived stable GIDs** — mass stations keep `1001 + i` in nose→tail order; carry-through correction nodes take a disjoint `1500+` block. | The correction inserts sub-nodes inside `[x_f, x_r]`; positional numbering would silently renumber every station aft of the wing whenever the correction grid changes. |

Non-blocking defaults adopted with them: `M_ub` is the residual of the **existing**
free body (no wing pitching moment or thrust/drag couple pulled in — M4-19/M4-21
own those); the closure tolerance is relative to peak `|Myy|`, not a bare
`abs_tol`; the fallback keeps the current caveat text renamed
`CLOSURE_ARTIFACT_CAVEAT`; the spar fractions are edited on the Geometry page
beside `ref_axis_pct`.

## Step 0 verification (2026-08-03) — done

Ref 1 Ch 15 p103 (`reference/code.txt:8366`) prescribes a **two-pass** procedure,
which the implementation follows literally:

> "Multiply the component weights by the linear and pitching load factors.
> Calculate the shear by progressively adding the inertia loads from the nose to
> the tail and include the air load on the tail. Calculate the moment from the
> nose to the tail by accumulating the area under the shear curve. **The moment at
> the aft end is the unbalanced moment.** The unbalanced moment is reacted by the
> wing at the front and rear spar attachments. Calculate the wing reactions.
> Recalculate the loads, shear and moments along the fuselage including the wing
> reactions."

So `M_ub` is the terminal `Myy` of the **wing-reaction-free** set (inertia + tail
air load) — which the module's existing integrator already produces. ("linear
**and pitching** load factors" is the M4-21 half; `θ̈ = 0` on these balanced trim
cases, so it does not affect this closure.)

**Sign convention.** `body_distribution` accumulates `Myy += Sz*(x - x_prev)`
nose→tail, so the terminal moment is `M = Σ fz_i*(L - x_i)` with `L` the aft-most
station. Imposing `ΣFz = 0` and `M = 0` gives the `(L - x_f)` form above.
Confirmed numerically on all four GA6 critical fuselage conditions (scratch check,
spar defaults 0.15/0.65 `c_root` → `x_f = 60.150`, `x_r = 110.650`, `d = 50.500`):

| Condition | `M_ub` (lb-in) | `R_total` (lb) | `R_f` (lb) | `R_r` (lb) | terminal `Myy` (this form) | terminal `Myy` (shipped today) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| MAX DOWN LOAD ON WING | −1 315 552 | 9 355 | −1 805 | 11 160 | 5.7e−11 | 368 969 |
| AFT DOWN BENDING | −1 486 338 | 10 916 | −3 072 | 13 988 | 3.7e−10 | 479 328 |
| AFT UP BENDING | 695 783 | −4 268 | −1 068 | −3 201 | −5.2e−11 | −72 845 |
| GREATEST NZ | −1 798 759 | 13 021 | −3 153 | 16 174 | 1.4e−10 | 545 914 |

Two findings carried into the plan: the reaction formula needed the `(L - x_f)`
correction (recorded above), and `R_f` is **negative** on every GA6 condition — a
front-spar pull-off, not a benign split of `R_total`. That is a real design number
for the fittings and vindicates reporting them (decision 3). The last column is
the defect this item closes.

## Step plan

**0 — Reference check.** ✅ Done (above). Cite p103 in the calc docstring and the
closure test.

**1 — Inputs.** ✅ Done. `front_spar_pct`/`rear_spar_pct` on `SurfaceInput`; resolver in
`derived_geometry.py` returning `(x_f, x_r, provenance)` or `None`;
`SCHEMA_VERSION` 34 → 35; `io.py` round-trip.

**2 — Calc (`modules/body_loads.py`).** ✅ Done. Build the point set **without** the
wing point reaction; `R_total = nz*W_fus − LT`; `M_ub` = that set's terminal
moment (about the integrator's aft-most station `x_ref`, **not** about `x_f` —
the planning draft of this step said `x_f`, which is what produced the wrong
`R_r = (M_ub + R_total*x_f)/d` above). Solve
`R_r = (M_ub + R_total*(x_ref − x_f))/d`, `R_f = R_total − R_r`. Apply over
`[x_f, x_r]` as uniform `R_total/d` plus `w(ξ) = 12*couple/d² * (ξ − ½)`
(`couple = (R_r − R_f)*d/2`, about the interval midpoint), lumped onto
`CARRY_THROUGH_NODES` sub-nodes by the exact linear-segment static equivalent
and merged into the sorted point list; re-integrate nose→tail unchanged. `d → 0`
collapses continuously onto the literal two-point A solve, so no tolerance
switch was needed. No spar stations → option B over the whole body with
`closure_artifact = True`.

Verified across the four GA6 conditions: ΣFz and terminal `Sz` ~1e-13 lb,
terminal `Myy` ~1e-10 lb-in (2e-16 … 1.4e-15 of peak bending), `R_f`/`R_r`
summing exactly to `R_total`; the fallback closing to the same precision;
`d → 0` continuity down to d = 0.005 in (closure held at rel 3.6e-12 while the
reactions grew as ±M/d — at d = 0.5 in the fittings would read ±930 000 lb,
which is the spike the distributed form exists to avoid); and node-count
independence exact at 2/3/5/9/33 nodes.

**3 — Export (`export/sbeam_bridge.py`).** ✅ Done. Stable GID scheme; `$ CAVEAT:`
only on the artifact path; a terminal-`Myy` line beside the ΣFz line;
fitting-loads CSV.

GIDs are keyed off `BodyStationLoad.source` (`mass` / `tail` / `carry` /
`correction`), not the station's index in the merged table — the carry-through
inserts nodes *into the middle* of the beam, so index-based GIDs would have
renumbered every mass station aft of the wing whenever a spar fraction moved.
Mass + tail stations keep the historical `1001 +` in nose→tail order; reaction
nodes take a disjoint `1501 +` block (each block holds 500; the tail family
starts at 2001, and `body_station_gids` raises rather than collide). Verified on
GA6: mass GIDs 1001–1007 are byte-identical before and after moving the spars
0.15/0.65 → 0.20/0.70, which inserts a `carry` node ahead of mass station 1003.

`body_fitting_load_csv` reports the fitting loads at ULTIMATE beside the FORCE
set rather than inside it — the exported distribution already carries the
reactions as the carry-through line load, so adding the point reactions would
double them. A `closure_artifact` case contributes no row.

Deferred into step 4 (they are GUI-side callers, not bridge code): registering
the fitting CSV as an Export-page artifact and as a workbook sheet.

**4 — GUI.** ✅ Done. `fuselage_loads.py`: dropped the `st.warning`, added a
terminal-`Myy` closure metric beside ΣFz, and a **Wing-attach reactions (LIMIT)**
row showing `R_f`/`R_r` at the resolved `x_f`/`x_r` plus `M_ub`, captioned with
the fraction provenance (assumed vs. entered) and the "already carried by the
distribution, do not apply again" warning. The artifact `st.warning` fires only
on the fallback path. `export_report.py`: the Fuselage row gained
`fuselage_fitting_loads.csv` (so it also enters the `.zip` bundle and the
workbook as a *Fuselage Fitting Loads* sheet), and its caption branches
artifact/closed. `configuration_layout.py`: optional front/rear spar `% chord`
number inputs per surface — **left blank they stay `None`**, which is what makes
the assumed-vs-entered provenance reachable from the GUI at all (before this
every project resolved as `assumed`).

Verified under `AppTest` on GA6: both closure metrics read `0.00`, the reaction
metrics read `R_f = −1 805.2` / `R_r = +11 159.8` lb LIMIT at X = 60.15/110.65 in
with the assumed-spars caption, no page warning; with the wing surface removed
the page shows the artifact warning and no reaction metrics; the Export page
lists `fuselage_fitting_loads.csv` among its sbeam artifacts.

**5 — Tests.** ✅ Done, in `tests/test_body_loads.py` (8 new, suite 528 → 536).
Terminal `Myy ≈ 0` + `ΣFz = 0` for every fuselage condition, each residual taken
**relative** to the loads that produced it (an absolute tolerance is meaningless
across cases whose peak bending spans 10⁵–10⁶ lb-in); `d → 0` continuity to the
two-point solve; the fallback flagging, closing, reporting no fitting loads and
carrying the caveat; `R_f + R_r == R_total` and the pair's moment about `x_ref`
recovering `−M_ub`; node-count independence; GID stability across a spar move
and block disjointness; the ULTIMATE fitting CSV's schema and scaling; io
round-trip of the new result fields and the station `source`. The inverted
caveat lock (`test_body_bdf_ships_no_caveat_on_the_carry_through_path`) landed in
step 2. FAR23 flight oracles unchanged — no flight-loads or envelope calc was
touched.

**6 — Docs (same session).** ✅ Done. `PROGRAM_SPEC.md` §`body_loads`,
`20_theory/00_theory_sources.md` oracle-status cell, backlog M4-1 →
`90_record/00_completed_development.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]`, this note
folded into the history entry, new terms into `cspell.json`.
