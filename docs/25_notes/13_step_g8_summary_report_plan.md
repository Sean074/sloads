# Step G8 — Consolidated Summary Report (Export phase) — implementation plan

**Owner:** @Sean074 · **Reviewers:** — *(design note 28 MD-6: the owner of what a note touches reviews it as a PR)*

**Backlog item:** M3-3b / Step G8 — the **second** M4 item, behind **M4-20**
(unit-system plumbing), which G8.5 onward is blocked on (§10.1). G8.4's
`content.py` is unit-independent and may start first.
**Source spec:** [`03_gui_rework_plan.md §4 Phase 6`](../30_future/03_gui_rework_plan.md) — the
four-section summary report.
**Document standard:** [`../10_standard/SUMMARY_REPORT.md`](../10_standard/SUMMARY_REPORT.md)
— the authoritative structure, required content and **excluded** content. Where
this plan and the standard disagree, **the standard wins**; §4 below is the
build-order reading of it, not a second specification.
**Status: ✅ COMPLETE — G8.1–G8.3 shipped 2026-08-04, G8.4–G8.7 (backlog M3-3b)
shipped 2026-08-05.** The report renders, compiles and ships in the bundle. The
record of what was built, the tests that hold it and the decisions taken along
the way is the history entry
[`../90_record/00_completed_development.md` → *M3-3b*](../90_record/00_completed_development.md);
the standard the result is judged against remains
[`../10_standard/SUMMARY_REPORT.md`](../10_standard/SUMMARY_REPORT.md), whose
§6 conformance list now names the test holding each box. This document is kept
as the plan of record for how the step was sequenced.

---

## 1. Goal

Produce **one controlled document** that a structural analyst can size airframe
structure from: the airplane, its weights and CG travel, its flight envelope, the
FAR conditions analysed, and every governing **ULTIMATE** load with its safety
factor — plus an explicit methods-and-limitations statement that travels with the
machine-readable deliverables (CSV / BDF) so downstream sizing inherits the
concept-mode caveat the UI already shows.

**Non-goal:** any change to the calc. No load equation, oracle figure or exported
number moves. Step G8 is a **new render/export channel over existing results**,
governed by the same ultimate-load boundary that `report.py` and
`export/sbeam_bridge.py` already own.

---

## 2. Locked decisions (user, this session)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| **G8-1** | **LaTeX only.** A pure renderer emits `.tex`; PDF is compiled when a TeX engine is on `PATH`, otherwise the `.tex` is served with a hint. The bundle always carries the `.tex`. | Controlled-document features (pagination, headers/footers, page *n of m*, ToC, figure/table numbering, `longtable`, signature/revision block) that browser print-to-PDF cannot give. No HTML backend — one renderer, one format. `tectonic` is present at `/opt/homebrew/bin/tectonic`. |
| **G8-2** | **Plots are pgfplots/TikZ emitted as text.** No plotly in the report, no `kaleido`, no refactor of the Streamlit plot code. | Deterministic, unit-testable source (the same way BDF cards are tested), vector output in the document's own fonts. The plot *data* already comes from pure functions (`vn_diagram.build_vn_diagram`, `weight_envelope.loading_envelope_points`), so no GUI extraction is needed to avoid divergence. |
| **G8-3** | **Methods statement stamped everywhere:** `$` comment block in each BDF, `#`-prefixed provenance lines above each CSV header, `METHODS.txt` in the zip, a `Methods` sheet in the workbook, and §5 of the report. | Follows the existing `body_loads.CLOSURE_ARTIFACT_CAVEAT` precedent for BDF. A CSV forwarded on its own still carries its basis. Accepted risk: naive CSV consumers see comment rows (mitigation in §7). |
| **G8-4** | **Depth: summary + every governing case, pointing at companions.** The report carries the governing cases, per-component V/M/T maxima and *where* they occur; full station-by-station distributions stay in the bundle's CSV/BDF files, named from the report. | A single self-contained PDF of every station × every case runs to hundreds of pages. The bundle is the deliverable; the report is its controlling document. |

---

## 3. Package layout

`sloads/report.py` becomes a package, exactly as `models.py` → `models/` did at
M3-1. `sloads/report/__init__.py` re-exports the current public names
(`results_to_rows`, `load_cases_to_rows`, `governing_loads_table`,
`module_text_report`, `text_report`, `has_load_case_data`, `ultimate_units`,
`to_ultimate`, `envelope_extremes`) so **every existing import keeps working
unchanged** — this is a mechanical move, not an API change.

```
sloads/report/
  __init__.py      re-exports render.* (back-compat) + the new document entry points
  render.py        <- today's report.py, verbatim (tables, ULT boundary, text report)
  methods.py       the ONE source of the methods & limitations statement + the
                   CSV `#` / BDF `$` comment blocks built from it
  coverage.py      FAR Subpart C coverage matrix (static reg table x this run's
                   far_reference values -> covered / n-a / not analysed)
  content.py       pure content model: Project + module results -> ReportDocument
                   (sections, tables, figures, notes). No LaTeX, no Streamlit.
  latex.py         pure renderer: ReportDocument -> .tex string (escaping,
                   longtable, document control block)
  plots_tex.py     pgfplots/TikZ emitters: V-n, weight/CG, speed-altitude
sloads/export/
  pdf.py           the only impure piece: engine discovery + subprocess compile
```

**Why a content model between the data and the `.tex`.** Tests assert structured
content (`doc.section("Design speeds").table.rows`) instead of matching LaTeX
strings, which makes them readable and resilient to formatting changes; and the
`.tex` renderer stays a dumb, fully-covered string function. It also leaves a
future HTML/Markdown backend as a small addition rather than a rewrite — without
building one now.

**I/O exemption (must be documented in the module docstring).** `sloads/export/pdf.py`
runs a subprocess and writes a temp directory, which the "calc never does I/O"
rule forbids for calc code. It is an *export-side* helper on the same footing as
`io.py`, it contains no math, and nothing in `sloads/report/` imports it — the
pure renderer never touches the filesystem. State this explicitly in the docstring
and in `PROJECT_GUIDE §4`, or it reads as a violation.

---

## 4. Report structure

Ten to twenty pages for a typical GA project, in this order. The normative
statement of this structure — including the whole-document rules (load marking,
traceability, axes/signs/stations, absence handling, units) and the **excluded
content** list — is [`../10_standard/SUMMARY_REPORT.md`](../10_standard/SUMMARY_REPORT.md).
What follows is the implementation reading: which existing pure function supplies
each block, and what is new work.

### Title page + document control
Project name, engineer, date, **revision**, checked-by / approved-by signature
block, category badge (**FAR 23** or **Concept (C) — unverified extrapolation**),
tool version + `SCHEMA_VERSION`, and the one-line basis statement
("All loads ULTIMATE; safety factor stated per case"). Table of contents follows.

### §1 — Input summary
Everything the analyst needs to confirm they were given the right airplane:

- **Configuration** — category, engine layout and count, engine/prop designation,
  turboprop flag, occupants / seats / crew, `include_far25` flag.
- **Geometry** — wing area, span, MAC, aspect ratio, taper, sweep, dihedral,
  incidence; h-tail and v-tail area/arm/volume-coefficient; elevator/rudder and
  aileron/flap/tab chord fractions; landing-gear stations and track; fuselage
  length and max width/depth.
- **Weights & CG** — MTOW, empty, fuel, payload; the per-CG design weights SELECT
  uses; forward/aft CG limits (in and %MAC) and the loading-envelope travel;
  mass properties (Iyy, Izz) with their provenance (WTONECG per-CG values vs. the
  Ch 9 approximation — see backlog M4-4).
- **Design speeds** — VS, VSF, VA, VC, VD, VF (and VMO/MMO when `mach_limit` ran),
  each with its FAR reference and whether it was user-set or derived.
- **Aero** — CLmax (clean / flapped), lift-curve slopes, CM set, and whether the
  Munk fuselage `dCm/dα` contribution is enabled.

Each table cites the page that owns the input, so a wrong number is traceable to
one screen.

### §2 — Envelope plots (pgfplots)
Three figures, **each with its corner-point table underneath** — the numbers must
be readable, not merely plotted:

1. **V-n diagram** — manoeuvre + stall boundaries, gust lines, flap envelope, from
   `vn_diagram.build_vn_diagram()`. Corner table: VS/VA/VC/VD/VF × n⁺/n⁻, with the
   gust-vs-manoeuvre governing flag per corner and a note when
   `gust_approximate` is set.
2. **Weight / CG envelope** — the loading-envelope polygon from
   `weight_envelope.loading_envelope_points()` with the fwd/aft limits and each
   design CG case marked. Corner table: weight, CG (in and %MAC), and the item
   sequence that produces each corner.
3. **Speed / altitude envelope** — VMO/MMO from `mach_limit.mach_limit_lines()`
   plus the derived-gust taper above 20,000 ft (`vn_diagram._gust_ude`). **This
   figure has no GUI equivalent today** — it is genuinely new work (small: two
   pure lines over an altitude sweep). If `speeds.mach_limit` is absent the figure
   is omitted and the section says so rather than drawing an empty axis.

### §3 — Conditions analysed + FAR coverage
- **Case index** — every structured case ID mapped to its full definition
  (component, condition, CG, speed, altitude, SF), rendered `longtable` in a small
  font, from the existing `sbeam_bridge.case_index_csv_from()`. State plainly
  whether the **full set** or the **governing set** (the Critical Loads opt-out
  selection) was exported, and list the deselected IDs if any — an analyst must
  never silently receive a filtered set.
- **FAR coverage matrix** (`report/coverage.py`) — a static table of the FAR 23
  Subpart C regulations the suite covers (sourced from `PROGRAM_SPEC.md` and the
  FAA User's Guide Table 2.2), each row cross-checked against the
  `far_reference` values this run actually produced: **covered** (with case
  count), **not applicable** (with the reason — e.g. 23.345 flap conditions on an
  unflapped airplane), or **not analysed** (inputs absent). This is the section
  that tells a reviewer what is *missing*, so "not analysed" rows must be visually
  distinct, not buried.
- **Approved corrections** — the three register entries (23.361(a)(1),
  23.361(a)(3), 23.427(a)) listed with their citations, since they are deliberate
  deviations from the source manual that a reviewer will otherwise flag.

### §4 — Results summary (all ULTIMATE, SF per case)
Per component, the governing cases via the existing
`report.governing_loads_table()` (already ULTIMATE-marked and SF-columned), plus a
maxima block naming *where* each maximum occurs:

| Component | Reported |
|-----------|----------|
| **Wing** | Governing cases (PHAA/PMAA/PLAA/NMAA); max shear / bending / torsion with the span station of each; the torsion axis named explicitly (LRA, % chord, from `net_loads.torsion_axis_label`); two-sided max **and** min envelopes. |
| **Fuselage** | Governing cases; max V/M/T with body station; the closure statement — the exported set closes both ΣFz and the terminal `Myy` at the front/rear spar attachments (M4-1); the wing-attach fitting loads, and `body_loads.CLOSURE_ARTIFACT_CAVEAT` **verbatim** whenever a case fell back to the whole-body correction. |
| **Horizontal / vertical tail** | Balancing, manoeuvre, gust and unsymmetrical conditions; the 25%/50% MAC chordwise split (`lt25`/`lt50`). |
| **Control surfaces** | Aileron / flap / tab: design pressures, hinge moments, and the *standard simplified* distribution used — flagged as such. |
| **Landing gear** | Reaction cases per gear (level, tail-down, one-wheel, side, braked) with the gear geometry they act on. |
| **Engine mount** | Torque, thrust, side and gyroscopic cases, incl. the four 23.371(b) sign combinations; note the preserved sign conventions (reaction torque reported negative; clockwise-from-pilot positive). |

### §5 — Methods & limitations
The full statement (§5 below drives its content) plus a **references** list: Ref 1
page citations per module (from `20_theory/00_theory_sources.md`), the CFR parts,
and the oracle-status statement.

### Appendix A — Bundle manifest
Each companion file: what it contains, its units, its sign convention, and which
report section summarises it. This is what makes the pointer-to-companions
decision (G8-4) safe — `wing_span_loads.csv` is useless without knowing its
torsion axis and that its loads are ULTIMATE.

---

## 5. The methods & limitations statement

Single source: `report/methods.py`. One function builds the full prose block; two
thin wrappers wrap it as `#` (CSV) and `$` (BDF) comment blocks. Content, assembled
per project:

1. **Basis** — loads are ULTIMATE (= limit × SF); SF stated per case; default 1.5
   per 14 CFR 23.303; load factors are limit and dimensionless.
2. **Category** — FAR 23 (normal/utility/acrobatic/commuter), *or* the concept-mode
   caveat: an unverified extrapolation above the FAR 23 calibration band, listing
   the specific applicability exceedances from `far23_applicability()`.
3. **Verification status** — the FAR 23 GA path is oracle-locked to Appendix A
   within ±0.1%; twin-turboprop cases are **closure-locked, not oracle-locked**
   (Appendix B is not bundled). Quote the `00_theory_sources.md` oracle-status
   wording rather than paraphrasing it.
4. **Modernized math** — `math.pi` and clean equations replace the source's
   `3.1416`, hence tolerance-based (±0.1%) rather than exact agreement.
5. **Approved corrections** — the three register entries, with citations.
6. **Known limitations** — the fuselage closure artifact (`CLOSURE_ARTIFACT_CAVEAT`, fallback path only) and assumed spar stations; *standard
   simplified* control-surface distributions; wing and control-surface exports
   always carry the full case set regardless of the governing-set filter (M4-2
   case-identity gap); no ground-case distributed fuselage loads; and
   pressurization **out of scope** (decision D-24 — an exclusion the report states
   as permanent, not a gap awaiting a release).
7. **Scope of this export** — full set vs. governing set, and the deselected IDs.
8. **Provenance** — tool version, `SCHEMA_VERSION`, project name/engineer/date/
   revision, and the generation timestamp.

**Determinism.** The timestamp is a caller-supplied argument
(`generated: Optional[str] = None`, omitted when `None`), never `datetime.now()`
inside the pure code — the GUI passes it. Two runs of the same project must
produce byte-identical `.tex`, or the tests become flaky and the diff between two
revisions becomes unreadable.

---

## 6. Sub-steps (dependency order)

Each sub-step ends with a green build (`ruff check sloads/ cli.py` clean, `pytest`
passing) and is independently reviewable.

**G8.1 — `report.py` → `report/` package.** ✅ *complete 2026-08-04*
Mechanical move (`git mv` by the user, per the git rule) plus
`__init__.py` re-exports. Acceptance: zero changes to any importing module; full
suite green; no test edits needed. *Do this first and alone* — mixing it with new
code makes the diff unreviewable.

**G8.2 — Document-control fields (schema).** ✅ *complete 2026-08-04*
Add optional `revision`, `checked_by`, `approved_by`, `description` to `Project`,
round-trip in `io.py`, bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` **35 → 36** (corrected 2026-08-03:
M4-1 consumed 35 for the wing spar fractions), add the fields to the
Project Dashboard / JSON editor. All default to `""`, so older files load
unchanged and the title page degrades gracefully when they are absent.
Regenerate `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`.

**G8.3 — `methods.py` + stamping (the backlog item's explicit ask).** ✅ *complete 2026-08-04*
The statement, plus wiring it into every channel:
`io.load_cases_csv`, the sbeam CSV writers and `case_index_csv*` gain a
`header_comment: str = ""` parameter; the BDF writers extend their existing `$`
block; the zip gains `METHODS.txt`; `build_workbook` gains a `Methods` sheet.
Guard test `tests/test_methods_stamp.py` (modelled on `test_ultimate_contract.py`):
every channel carries the statement, and every stamped CSV still parses.

**G8.4 — `content.py` + `coverage.py`.** ✅ *`coverage.py` 2026-08-04; `content.py` 2026-08-05*
The `ReportDocument` model and the builder that fills §§1–4 from a `Project` and
`registry.run_all_modules()`. The FAR coverage table. No LaTeX yet — this
sub-step is fully testable on its own.

**G8.5 — `latex.py` + `plots_tex.py`.** ✅ *complete 2026-08-05*
The `.tex` renderer: preamble (`article`, `geometry`, `booktabs`, `longtable`,
`fancyhdr`, `pgfplots`, `hyperref`), LaTeX escaping of every user-supplied string
(project names contain `&`, `_`, `%`), the document-control block, and the three
pgfplots figures. Landscape or reduced font for the wide case-index table.

**G8.6 — `export/pdf.py` + Export page UI.** ✅ *complete 2026-08-05*
Engine discovery (`tectonic` → `latexmk` → `pdflatex`, first found), compile in a
temp dir, return bytes; surface engine/compile failure as a caption, never an
exception. A new **Summary report** section on `app/views/export_report.py` —
`.tex` download always, `.pdf` download when an engine is available, plus the
report and `METHODS.txt` in the zip bundle. *No new nav entry*: Phase 6's
direction is consolidation, and the Export page is already the hand-off page. (The
alternative — a dedicated `summary_report` workflow step — is noted here and
rejected; revisit only if the section outgrows the page.)

**G8.7 — Doc sync + close-out.** ✅ *complete 2026-08-05*
`SUMMARY_REPORT.md` (reconcile the standard with what shipped — any content rule
the implementation forced a change to updates the standard, not just the code),
`PROGRAM_SPEC.md` (the report as an export channel), `PROJECT_GUIDE.md §4`
(package layout + the `export/pdf.py` I/O exemption), `GUI_design.md` /
`GUI_USER_GUIDE.md` (the new Export section), `20_theory/00_theory_sources.md`
(coverage-table provenance: User's Guide Table 2.2), backlog → history,
`CHANGELOG.md`. The LaTeX toolchain terms (tectonic, pgfplots, longtable,
fancyhdr, booktabs, hyperref, latexmk, …) are already seeded in `cspell.json`,
which was created 2026-08-03 — add any further new terms there as usual.

---

## 7. Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **CSV `#` comment lines break a consumer.** `pandas.read_csv` needs `comment="#"`; the workbook builder and the Export page's `DictReader` currently read these strings back. | Audit every in-repo reader in G8.3 (`export/workbook.py::_csv_to_df`, `export_report.py` case-index preview, tests) and fix in the same commit. Guard test asserts a stamped CSV round-trips to the same rows as an unstamped one. Keep the block to ≤5 lines. |
| **No TeX engine on the machine / on a future Streamlit Cloud deploy.** | By design (G8-1): `.tex` always downloads, PDF is best-effort, the bundle is complete without it. UI states which engine was used or why there is none. |
| **`tectonic`'s first run downloads its package bundle** (needs network, then caches). | Documented in the UI hint and the user guide. Never invoked during tests except the opt-in compile test. |
| **`report.py` → package move churn.** | Isolated as G8.1, back-compat re-exports, no test edits — if the suite needs edits, the move was wrong. |
| **A wide case index overflows the page.** | `longtable` + small font + landscape for that table; cap the columns to the ones an analyst needs, with the full set in the companion CSV. |
| **Report drifts from the GUI numbers.** | The report calls the same pure builders the pages do (`run_all_modules`, `build_critical`, `governing_loads_table`, `build_vn_diagram`); it must not recompute anything itself. A test asserts the report's governing-load figures equal `governing_loads_table()`'s. |
| **Scope creep into calc.** | Invariant test: the Appendix A oracle suite and `test_ultimate_contract.py` are untouched and pass throughout. |

---

## 8. Tests

| File | Asserts |
|------|---------|
| `tests/test_report_content.py` | The `ReportDocument` built from `examples/ga6_normal` carries all five sections; weights/speeds/geometry cells equal the project's values; the governing-case count equals `build_critical().selected()`; sections degrade (not raise) when a slice is absent. |
| `tests/test_far_coverage.py` | Every reg in the static table is either covered by a real `far_reference` from the GA fixture or classified with a reason; no reg is silently dropped; an unflapped project marks 23.345 not-applicable. |
| `tests/test_report_latex.py` | `.tex` renders for the GA and both concept fixtures; LaTeX specials in a project name are escaped; the VA corner point appears in the V-n `\addplot` coordinates; `-ULT` markers and the `SF` column are present; the concept caveat appears **only** in the concept fixtures; two renders are byte-identical. |
| `tests/test_methods_stamp.py` | The statement reaches CSV, BDF, `METHODS.txt`, the workbook sheet and the report; stamped CSVs parse to unchanged rows; the concept caveat and the fuselage closure-artifact caveat are present when applicable. |
| `tests/test_pdf_compile.py` | `skipif` no engine: compiles the GA report, asserts `%PDF-` magic and ≥1 page. Skipped in CI by design. |
| `tests/test_views_smoke.py` (extend) | The Export page's new section renders without exception when every slice is absent. |
| Unchanged | Every Appendix A oracle test and `test_ultimate_contract.py` — the invariant. |

---

  is ticked, each by a named test.
- `sloads/report/` package in place, all prior imports working, suite green.
- The report renders for `examples/ga6_normal`, the twin fixture and both concept
  fixtures; PDF compiles locally with `tectonic`.
- The methods statement is present in **every** export channel, guard-tested.
- No calc change: Appendix A oracles and the ultimate-load contract pass unchanged.
- `ruff` clean; new domain terms in `cspell.json`.
- Six doc artifacts synced (`PROGRAM_SPEC`, `PROJECT_GUIDE`, `GUI_design` /
  `GUI_USER_GUIDE`, `00_theory_sources`, backlog → history, `CHANGELOG`).
- Backlog entry removed, history entry added, `[Unreleased]` changelog entry added
  — same session, per the lifecycle rule.

## 10. Open questions for the next session

1. **Report units** — ***Resolved 2026-08-03: honour the user's selection.*** The
   report (and the whole export bundle, sbeam BDF included) renders in the system
   the user chose — GUI toggle, persisted project field, CLI `--units` override,
   default Imperial. SI markers (`N-ULT`, `Nm-ULT`, `kPa-ULT`), no dual display,
   KEAS/altitude unconverted, unit system stated on the title page and in-band in
   every companion file. The standard is `../10_standard/SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §3.5;
   the enabling work (project field, CLI flag, unit-aware BDF/CSV writers) is
   backlog **M4-20** and is a prerequisite for G8's conformance tests.
2. **`revision` semantics** — a free-text field the user types, or an
   auto-incrementing counter stored in the project? Recommendation: **free text**,
   with a revision-history table the user maintains.
3. **Engine preference order** — ***Resolved 2026-08-05 (G8.6): `tectonic` →
   `latexmk` → `pdflatex`, first found wins, overridden entirely by the
   `SLOADS_TEX_ENGINE` environment variable*** (a binary name or an absolute
   path). tectonic is self-contained and needs no TeX Live; the env var is the
   escape hatch for a machine that would rather use its own installation.

**Resolved 2026-08-04 while implementing G8.2 — G8-5, `revision` semantics:**
**free text** the engineer maintains, not a tool-managed counter. A counter the
tool increments would disagree with the drawing/report system of record the
moment a project is copied or branched, and revision identity belongs to the
engineering process rather than to a file. Recorded in the decision register.

**Note on §10.1 (report units) and M4-20.** M4-20 shipped 2026-08-04, so the
renderer was written against the unit-aware writers rather than retrofitted: the
bundle's system is a parameter of `build_report`/`render_report`, the tables
resolve `deliverable_units(system, Channel.HUMAN)`, and the manifest names the
solver channel's consistent set beside it. §3.5 conformance is held by the unit
tests listed in `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §6.
