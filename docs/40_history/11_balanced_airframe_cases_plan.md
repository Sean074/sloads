# Design note — Balanced full-airframe load cases (free-free)

**Owner:** @Sean074 · **Reviewers:** — *(design note 28 MD-6: the owner of what a note touches reviews it as a PR)*

**Raised:** 2026-08-08 (user). **Status:** design agreed at the decision level
(B-1…B-4 answered by the user, 2026-08-08). **Step B1 SHIPPED 2026-08-08** — see
the history entry "The mass single source of truth" in
[`../40_history/00_completed_development.md`](../40_history/00_completed_development.md);
**B2–B6 SHIPPED 2026-08-08** (see the history entry "Balanced free-free
airplane cases"); B7 onward not yet implemented. **Closure tier:** L — new physics concept
(`BalancedCase`), a schema change, a new module, and a change to what the mass
model means.

**Goal, in the user's words:** *a full airplane balanced case — wing tip to wing
tip, nose to tail — with no need for a constraint, because the loads balance.
A wing case has its corresponding tail load and the resulting inertia loads.
Residual inertia may be used, but the change in inertia load should be small.*

## 1. Measured baseline (2026-08-08, before any change)

Every number below was computed from `examples/ga6_normal.project.json` on the
current `main`. They are the reason the plan takes the shape it does.

### 1.1 The airplane already balances at trim level

V-n point **case 22** (PHAA, `nz` = 3.8017, W = 3400 lb):

```
lzw = 12969.2    lt = -43.4    lzw + lt = 12925.8 == nz*W = 12925.8   ✓ exact
```

`flight_envelope._balance` closes rigid-body vertical equilibrium exactly, and
`test_concept_closure.py` already asserts it. **The balance is not missing — it
is missing *downstream*, in the distributed loads.**

### 1.2 The distributed loads do not inherit it

| Term | lb |
|---|---|
| Wing net root shear, both sides (2 × 5836.9) | +11,674 |
| Wing reaction the fuselage assumes (`body_loads` `carry` source) | +10,479 |
| **Seam mismatch** | **1,195 = 9.2 % of n·W** |

`body_loads` closes to zero *by construction* — `carry` = `mass` + `tail`
identically — but it closes on a reaction it computes for itself, not on what
the wing delivers. Wing and body currently disagree about the seam load by 9 %.

### 1.3 There are two independent mass models, and they do not reconcile

| Source | Content | Total |
|---|---|---|
| `weight.items` | 24 itemized masses, each with x/y/z and inertias | **3400.0 lb at cg_x 85.00** — matches `mass.cases[0]` exactly |
| `fuselage_mass.stations` | 5 hand-entered lumps, feeding the Ch 15 beam | **2578 lb** |

`weight.items` less the wing panel (330), h-tail (42) and v-tail (23) leaves
**3005 lb** that belongs to the fuselage beam, against the **2578 lb** entered —
a **427 lb** discrepancy with nothing anywhere reconciling it. The itemized
model is the good one: it closes to W and to the CG by construction.

### 1.4 With the item model and correct pairing, the airplane balances to 0.32 %

Assembling case 22 properly — wing strips both sides, tail at its trim value,
inertia from all 24 items at that point's `nz`:

```
wing air (from strips, 2 sides)  +12928.3      [= 2 x net root 11673.7 + nz x 330 wing inertia]
tail air (trim lt)                   -43.4
inertia (all 24 items x nz)      -12925.8
                                 ---------
residual                            -41.0 lb  =  0.317 % of n*W
                                                 dn = -0.0120 g  (0.317 % of n)
```

**The 1 % gate is achievable today, with margin.** And the residual has a single
identified source: the AIRLOADS strip quadrature integrates to 12928.3 lb
against the FLTLOADS closed-form `lzw` of 12969.2 — a −41.0 lb (−0.32 %)
discretization difference. Nothing else contributes, because the item mass model
closes to W exactly and the CG-referred inertia moment is identically zero by
the definition of the CG.

This is the finding that makes the work worth doing: **the physics is already
consistent to 0.3 %; what is missing is the assembly.**

## 2. Agreed decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| B-1 | **The balanced case is owned by the flight condition.** One `BalancedCase` per distinct V-n point referenced by any component's critical condition; today's `W-xx` / `F-xx` / `HT-xx` picks become **views** (a down-select) over that set | Fixes case pairing at its root. The key already exists: `CriticalCondition.case` is the V-n point index (PHAA → case 22), and `CaseRef` carries cg / speed / altitude. Nothing new has to be invented to pair them |
| B-2 | **`weight.items` is the mass SSOT**, with an item→station mapping. `fuselage_mass.stations` becomes derived from it (or validated against it), guarded by `Σw = W` and `Σw·x = W·x_cg` | §1.3. The itemized model already closes exactly; the beam distribution does not derive from it, which is where the 427 lb goes missing |
| B-3 | **Residual closed as 2-DOF mass-proportional inertia relief** — `Δn` on every mass plus `−mᵢ·Δθ̈·(xᵢ−x_cg)` — gated at **\|Δn\|/n < 1 %** and residual moment < 1 % of `n·W·MAC`; over the gate the case **fails** rather than silently absorbing the error | §1.4 says 0.32 % today, so the gate bites on regressions, not on the physics. The pitch term is self-equilibrating in force by construction (`Σmᵢ(xᵢ−x_cg) ≡ 0`), so the two DOF do not fight each other |
| B-4 | **New assembled deck per balanced case**, alongside today's per-component decks; solved in sbeam on a **statically determinate support** with the reactions gated to ≈ 0 | sbeam's SOL 101 has no inertia relief (`SUPORT` is honoured by the SOL 144 trim partition only — verified 2026-08-08). A determinate support carries exactly the residual, so "reactions ≈ 0" *is* the free-free equilibrium proof, through the solver's own assembly |

**Phasing (user, 2026-08-08; re-sequenced by the 2026-08-08 critical review —
see §2.1):** start with the **wing** cases. Phase 1 is **symmetric flight
cases** (PHAA, PLAA, PMAA, NMAA…). Phase 2 is the antisymmetric wing cases
(`ACRL`, `TORS`) *plus* the B-6 handedness machinery (distinct left/right
loading, 6-DOF residual). Phase 3 is the **empennage** cases (needs plan 09's
distributed tail, pulled forward in the development sequence); phase 4 is
**landing/ground** (needs M4-6).

### 2.1 Revision — 2026-08-08 critical review (decisions B-5…B-8, user)

The development-plan review against the stated aims (full-span model; left and
right cases; mass export first) added four decisions and re-sequenced the
phases. Where they conflict with §2/§5 as first written, **these govern.**

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| B-5 | **The assembled full-span deck is the *primary* loads deliverable.** Per-component half-span decks remain as analysis/debug **views** — still exported, still oracle-backing, still gated by plans 07/10 — but the balanced full-span free-free deck is what the mission's sizing loop consumes | The airplane model shall be full span (user aim). Consequences: the left/right wing GID band split lands in B5, the round-trip harness (plan 10) gains an assembled-deck leg once B5 exists, and the side-of-body item demotes to a reporting-node addition on the assembled model (a free-free model has no clamp; the SOB load is internal and merely needs a node) |
| B-6 | **Every asymmetric case family gets a systematic left/right twin, generated at the balanced-case assembly level by reflection** (`y → −y`, side quantities negated): yaw ±β (23.441/443), aileron roll ±, OEI left/right engine, 23.427 unsymmetrical tail both sides. SELECT and the V-n core are untouched; the FAR23 oracles cannot move | Mirroring at assembly derives the opposite-hand case from the computed one without touching the oracle-locked path. The reflection operator gets **one owner** (`export/coordinates.py`, beside the axis maps) plus a drift-guard test — `CLAUDE.md` practice 3, and the same reasoning that put the v-tail axis map there in plan 09 |
| B-7 | **Case identity: `BalancedCase` keys on the minted `CaseRef`, not on the V-n point index.** Handedness is a **suffix on the existing case id** (`VT-03L` / `VT-03R`), minted by the balance layer; the unhanded id remains the physical condition | B-1's "one per V-n point" fails for exactly the cases the aims add: `CriticalCondition.case` is `None` for derived conditions, and landing cases have no V-n point at all (verified 2026-08-08: `select.py` carries `case=p.case` for wing/tail/fuselage picks, `None` on derived ones). Keying on `CaseRef` covers all four families with one rule and no new ID series (naming rule, 2026-08-05) |
| B-8 | **Lateral cases close with a lateral analog of B-3:** mass-proportional `Δn_y` plus `Δψ̈·(xᵢ−x_cg)`, gated at the same 1 %. Requires stating the lateral trim balance first — the fin side load is reacted by lateral inertia (`n_y·W`) and yaw acceleration (`I_zz·ψ̈`), and **no lateral load factor exists anywhere in the suite today** (plan 09 omits v-tail inertia for that reason) | The ±β cases are the aims' named example; they cannot balance without a lateral inertia model. The 23.441 machinery already carries `IZZ` (`VTailLoadsInput.izz_slugft2`), so the yaw-acceleration half has a data source; the `n_y` half is new physics and must be designed in the phase-3 design note before code, per `CLAUDE.md` practice 1 |

## 3. What changes, by area

### 3.1 New — `sloads/mass_distribution.py` (the SSOT, B-2)

The single owner that turns `weight.items` into per-component station inertia.

- **Component assignment.** Each item is tagged to a component — `wing`,
  `fuselage`, `htail`, `vtail`, `gear`, `engine` — by an explicit optional
  `component` field on the item, defaulting to inference from `(x, y, z)`
  against the geometry. Explicit beats inferred; inference exists so the five
  existing fixtures need no hand editing to load.
- **Distribution within a component.** Wing items spread over the WINGINER
  spanwise mass distribution (which already tapers root→tip); fuselage items
  lump at their own `x` as beam stations; tail items feed plan 09's
  `TailMassInput` when that lands, and lump at `xt25` until then.
- **Drift guards** (`CLAUDE.md` practice 3 — a structural owner plus a test):
  `Σw = mass_case.weight_lb`; `Σw·x = W·cg_x`; `Σw·z = W·cg_z`; and
  `wing item weight == 2 × wing_mass.panel_weight_lb` — which ga6 already
  satisfies exactly (330 = 2 × 165), so the tie is real and worth locking.
- **`fuselage_mass.stations` becomes derived.** Keep the input for backward
  compatibility, but validate it against the derived distribution and surface
  the difference. **ga6 will fail this validator by 427 lb on day one** — that
  is the intended outcome, not a surprise; it is the fixture that is wrong.

### 3.2 New — `sloads/modules/balance.py` and the `BalancedCase` result (B-1)

For each distinct V-n point referenced by any component's `CriticalCondition`:

1. **Assemble the applied aero set** — wing strips (both sides; mirrored for
   symmetric cases), the tail load at `xt25`/`xt50`, control-surface increments
   where the case names them.
2. **Assemble the inertia set** from §3.1 at that point's `nz` (plus `θ̈` once
   M4-21 lands; `θ̈ = 0` on balanced trim points, so phase 1 is unaffected).
3. **Compute the residual** `(ΣFz, ΣFx, ΣMy about the CG)`.
4. **Close it** with `Δn` and `Δθ̈` (B-3), and record both the pre-closure
   residual and the closure magnitudes on the result — the numbers are the
   deliverable's own honesty statement, not internal scratch.

`BalancedCaseResult` carries the case identity (reusing `CaseRef`), the V-n
point, the per-component load sets, the pre-closure residual and the applied
`Δn`/`Δθ̈`.

### 3.3 Changed — the seam rule, which is also plan 09's T-11 answer (§4)

### 3.4 Changed — `body_loads`

`BodyLoadResult` gains `nz` (plan 07 §9 names its absence as a blocker) and a
link to its V-n point. Its own free-free closure is unchanged and stays
oracle-neutral; what changes is that the assembled case does **not** consume its
`carry` reaction (§4).

### 3.5 New — the assembled export (**the primary deliverable, B-5**)

One deck per balanced case: GRIDs for both wings, the fuselage and the
empennage; `FORCE`/`MOMENT` for every applied load; a determinate support; and
a `$` header stating the case's condition, its residual and its `Δn`. Needs a
**left/right wing GID band** — today's wing band (2…N) is a single half-span —
folded into plan 07 step 3's disjointness guard. Per B-5 this deck is the
mission's primary loads deliverable; the per-component decks stay as views.
Asymmetric cases are emitted as **handed pairs** (B-6/B-7): the computed case
plus its reflection, `-L`/`-R` suffixed, both in the same deck as separate
subcases.

## 4. The double-count authority table (answers plan 09 decision T-11)

In an assembled free-free model every load is either **external** (applied) or
**internal** (recovered by the solver). Today's per-component decks each take a
free-body cut and carry the cut reaction as an applied load; those reactions
must **not** appear in the assembled deck. Stated once, as the rule:

| Physical load | Per-component deck | Assembled deck | LRA beam model (step 12, added 2026-08-15 — note 24 R-6) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wing air load | wing strips, centerline→tip, one side | wing strips, **both sides** — authoritative | both sides, transferred onto the LRA nodes; strips **inboard of the SOB summed to the SOB node** (resultant preserved) |
| Wing inertia | inside the wing net | from `weight.items` wing item, spread by WINGINER — authoritative | as assembled, transferred; inboard-of-SOB share summed to the SOB node |
| Wing carry-through reaction | `body_loads` `carry` source — applied | **excluded** — it is internal (the solver recovers it) | **excluded** — carried by the **posts** (rigid links, front/rear spar → SOB); the post loads are the solver's, gated in resultant against `body_loads`' p103 split |
| Fuselage inertia | `fuselage_mass.stations` × `nz` | from `weight.items`, per §3.1 — authoritative | as assembled, transferred onto the section-centre line |
| Tail air load | `body_loads` `tail` point load **and** TAILDIST chordwise | the **distributed empennage** representation once plan 09 lands; the `body_loads` point load is **excluded**. Until then, the point load is authoritative and the chordwise deck is a per-component view | distributed empennage sets on the h-tail / fin LRA nodes; the `body_loads` point load **excluded** |
| **T7 T-tail tip transfer** (h-tail `Fz`/`Myy` lumped at the fin tip) | per-component fin deck — **applied** (the h-tail has no nodes there) | n/a (the assembled deck carries the h-tail set itself) | **excluded** — the h-tail beam is attached to the fin tip node; the solver recovers the transfer |
| Gear reactions | — | applied external loads on ground cases (M4-6) at the `attach` node | applied at the `attach` node, which is rigid-linked to its parent beam (fuselage or wing, `mounted_on`) |
| **Engine thrust / mount loads** | ENGLOADS `LoadValue`s only | the entered `EngineInput.thrust_lb` as one axial `FORCE` per engine at its hub, **flight cases only** (#10, shipped 2026-08-17); the mount loads still none | thrust `FORCE` on the **hub** node — transferred there with a zero couple, since the load is built at that node's own position — and ENGLOADS torque/gyro `MOMENT` on the **mount** node, still absent; both rigid to the parent beam. **Half shipped:** the hub `FORCE` carries the entered thrust, taken **axial** rather than along the P-6 line (the incidence/toe angles are parked with note 21, whose §4.4 also owns reflection with engine loads); the mount node is still emitted with no applied card |

The rule in one sentence, for `CONVENTIONS.md`: **a load that a free-body cut
introduces is never applied in the assembled model.** For the LRA model the
same rule reads: **a load that a rigid attachment carries is never applied
across it** — the T7 transfer, the carry-through and the gear/engine link loads
are all recovered by the solver, never re-applied.

## 5. Steps

| Step | Scope | Tier | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~**B1**~~ | ~~`mass_distribution.py` + item `component` tagging + the drift guards + `fuselage_mass` reconciliation validator. Schema bump + migration.~~ **SHIPPED 2026-08-08** (schema v41) | L | M (~1 session) |
| ~~**B2**~~ ✅ | `BalancedCase` model, `balance.py`, the per-condition assembly and the 2-DOF residual closure. **Symmetric wing cases only.** | L | M–L (~1.5) |
| ~~**B3**~~ ✅ | The §4 seam rule made structural: an authority function the assembled path consumes, plus a guard test that the `carry` source never reaches an assembled deck. | M | S (~0.5) |
| ~~**B4**~~ ✅ | CI gates: residual < 1 %, `Δn`/n < 1 %, per-component decks and Appendix A **bit-unchanged**. | M | S (~0.5) |
| ~~**B5**~~ ✅ | Assembled deck export (**primary deliverable, B-5**) + left/right GID bands + determinate support; solves in sbeam with reactions ≈ 0 (rides on plan 10's harness, which gains an assembled-deck leg here). | L | M (~1) |
| ~~**B6**~~ ✅ | Streamlit view: the balanced case list with its residual and `Δn` columns — the number an engineer needs to trust the case. | M | S–M (~0.5) |
| ~~**B7**~~ ✅ | Antisymmetric wing cases: the roll DOF, the applied aileron couple, **the B-6 reflection operator in `export/coordinates.py` and the B-7 handed-pair minting** — the machinery every later ± family reuses. **SHIPPED 2026-08-08**; see §10 for what the measurement changed. **Phase 2.** | L | M–L (~1.5) |
| **B8a** | Empennage cases (needs plan 09 T1–T4): ±β yaw pairs per B-6, lateral closure per B-8. **Its design note is written** — [`13_b8a_lateral_closure_plan.md`](../40_history/18_b8a_lateral_closure_plan.md), 2026-08-08: the lateral balance stated, the `n_y`/`ψ̈` baseline measured, decisions **L-1…L-8** open, and a **replacement gate set** (plan 11 §6's "residual < 1 % before closure" is unpassable laterally — the pre-closure residual *is* the applied fin load, the same standing as §10's roll finding). **Phase 3.** | L | M–L |
| **B8b** | Landing/ground cases (needs M4-6: gear reactions as applied loads — the gear items are already in `weight.items` at x = 97 and x = 1). **Phase 4.** | L | M |
| **B9** | Tier-L closure trail: `CONVENTIONS.md` (§4 rule + the balanced-case concept), `PROGRAM_SPEC.md`, `theory_sources.md` (the closure gate as oracle substitute), `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`, `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` regen, CHANGELOG, history. | S | S (~0.5) |

Phase 1 = B1–B6; phase 2 = B7 (shipped 2026-08-08).

## 6. Acceptance

1. Every balanced case satisfies `|ΣF|/(n·W) < 1 %` and `|ΣM_cg|/(n·W·MAC) < 1 %`
   **before** residual closure, on all fixtures — the gate is on the physics,
   not on the correction.
2. `|Δn|/n < 1 %` after closure; the value is recorded on the result and shown
   in the UI and the deck header.
3. The mass drift guards hold on every fixture: `Σw = W`, `Σw·x = W·x_cg`,
   `Σw·z = W·z_cg`, wing item = 2 × panel weight.
4. The assembled deck solves in sbeam with determinate-support reactions ≈ 0 at
   the plan 07 §4.1 zero-target tolerance.
5. **Appendix A oracles bit-unchanged, and every per-component deck
   byte-unchanged.** This work is additive; if a digest moves, something leaked.
6. No `carry`-source load appears in any assembled deck (B3's guard).
7. `ruff` clean, `pytest` green on 3.9 / 3.11 / 3.12.

## 7. Risks and open technical questions

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ~~R1~~ **RESOLVED 2026-08-08** | **Where does `m_wf` go?** The trim solve carries a wing+fuselage aero pitching moment (26,355 lb-in at case 22). The wing's own section `Cm` is already in the strip torsion (`Trq = ΣML`); the *fuselage* Munk term has no distributed carrier until **M4-19**. Applying it twice, or not at all, lands directly in the moment residual | **The one genuine unknown in this plan.** §1.4 measured the force residual (0.32 %); the moment residual cannot be quoted until this is decided. Resolve it in B2 before writing the gate, and expect M4-19 to pair |
| R2 | ga6's `fuselage_mass` fails the new validator by 427 lb | Intended. The fixture is corrected in B1; the FAR23 oracles do not read `fuselage_mass`, so Appendix A is unaffected — **verify that claim explicitly in B1**, do not assume it |
| R3 | Strip-quadrature vs closed-form lift (−41 lb) sets a floor on achievable residual | 0.32 % against a 1 % gate is comfortable, but a fixture with coarser `elements` will do worse. Consider scaling the gate with element count, or state the floor per fixture |
| R4 | Antisymmetric cases need both wings loaded differently and a 6-DOF residual | Deferred to B7 by the phasing decision; B2's data structures should not assume symmetry even though phase 1 only exercises it |
| R5 | Scope creep into L-1 (real stiffness) | The assembled deck here uses the same placeholder properties as today's stick model. Reactions on a determinate support are stiffness-independent, so the gate is valid without real sections; L-1 improves the deck, not the check |
| R6 | `BalancedCase` becoming a second, competing case-identity system | It reuses `CaseRef` and `case_ids.py` — no new ID series (`CLAUDE.md` naming rule). Component cases become views over balanced cases, not parallel objects |

## 8. Effort

**L, phased.** Phase 1 (B1–B6) ≈ 4–5 sessions. Phase 2 (B7) ≈ 1.5. Phase 3
(B8a) depends on plan 09 T1–T4 landing first; phase 4 (B8b) depends on M4-6. Recommended on a feature branch with
a merge at each phase boundary, for the same reasons plan 09 gives.

## 9. What this supersedes

Plan 07 §9 ("Assembled-airframe n·W closure for symmetric cases") recommended
filing exactly this as its own `[E]` item. **This plan is that item** — filed
with the decisions answered and the baseline measured, so it should be entered
in `00_backlog.md` under that name pointing here, rather than as a second entry.


## 10. B7 as shipped (2026-08-08) — what measurement changed

Phase 2 landed as `ROLLING_WING_CONDITIONS`, a fourth closure DOF, the B-6
reflection operator and the B-7 handed-pair minting. Three of this note's
assumptions did not survive contact with the fixtures, and the corrections are
the substance of the step.

**1. `TORS` is not antisymmetric.** §2's phasing names "the antisymmetric wing
cases (`ACRL`, `TORS`)", but handedness lives entirely in
`WingLoadCase.unbal_moment`, and **every shipped fixture enters zero for `TORS`**
(ga6 and the RJ both). That is not a fixture oversight: a *steady* roll has no
unbalanced rolling moment by definition — the aileron moment is balanced by roll
damping — and the up-going/down-going aero asymmetry that remains has no
spanwise representation anywhere in this suite. `TORS` therefore joined
`SYMMETRIC_WING_CONDITIONS` and is assembled as the symmetric case it is, with
`test_only_acrl_carries_roll` pinning the finding so a fixture that ever enters a
rolling `TORS` goes red rather than being assembled symmetrically and quietly
meaning nothing. **Only `ACRL` produces handed twins** (ga6 UNB −149,043 in-lb,
RJ −600,000).

**2. The roll residual is not an error, and must not be gated like one.** R4
anticipated "a 6-DOF residual"; what it did not anticipate is that on a rolling
case `residual_mx` is the **applied aileron couple** — 6.71 % of `n·W·b/2` on ga6
ACRL, 2.00 % on the RJ — which the airplane is *supposed* not to balance. It
rolls; FAR 23.349 is about the loads while it does. Gating it at 1 % would have
failed a correct case. It is reported, and reacted in full by the roll DOF of the
closure, on exactly the standing `delta_nx` already has for drag: nothing else in
an assembled model can react it.

**3. The closure DOF *is* WINGINER's model, and that is the gate.** Closing the
roll residual with `k_roll*w_i*y_i` — physically `−m_i*p_dot*y_i` — reproduces
WINGINER's own unit-roll inertia distribution (`fz_r`, normalised on `iwxx`)
**strip for strip, ratio 1.000000, on both fixtures**, with the
wing-item/panel scale (0.9903 ga6, 1.0100 RJ) cancelling identically because the
closure normalises on the same masses the assembled model carries. Two producers
— oracle-locked FAR 23 code and a residual solve that knows nothing about it —
one answer. That identity is the B7 closure gate
(`test_roll_closure_reproduces_winginer`), standing in for the printed oracle
concept mode does not have. All six DOF then close to machine precision, and both
twins solve in sbeam with reactions ≈ 0 through plan 10's assembled leg.

**Decision of record (user, 2026-08-08): the applied couple is lumped.**
`AileronLoadsInput` carries areas and no butt lines, so there is no spanwise
station to distribute an aileron lift increment over. The couple is applied as a
single labelled free moment at the wing aerodynamic centre — the same treatment
and the same honesty as the lumped fuselage `Cm` — which **reduces exactly to the
oracle-locked FAR 23 model**, since WINGINER also carries only the inertia
reaction and never the aileron's own aero. The distributed antisymmetric load the
wing actually sees is fully spanwise. The limitation is stated in the deck
header, the case notes and the UI, and is filed on the backlog.

**Also filed:** the RJ's three high-speed low-CL cases exceed the 1 % pitch
residual gate (PLAA 1.041 %, PMAA 0.967 %, TORS 1.174 %). `TORS` is newly
assembled at B7 and merely exposed the pattern PLAA already showed; ga6 — the
Appendix A fixture — meets the gate on every case at 0.12–0.29 %. Bounded per
fixture (plan R3's "state the floor per fixture") rather than by widening the
gate for everyone.
