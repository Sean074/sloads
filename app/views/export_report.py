"""Export & Report — every output of the suite in one place.

Five kinds of hand-off, all recomputed live from the project inputs:

* **Project file** — the canonical ``project.json`` (the save file / single source
  of truth).
* **Load-case CSVs & text report** — per-module results for spreadsheets / records.
* **sbeam BDF cards** — wing / fuselage / tail / control-surface ``FORCE``/``MOMENT``
  cards (and the wing stick model) for the sbeam finite-element bridge, plus the
  **assembled full-span free-free deck** — the mission's primary loads
  deliverable, of which the per-component decks are analysis views — and the
  **CONM2/MASSSET mass model** that checks its inertia half independently.
* **Summary report (Step G8)** — the controlling document of the deliverable: a
  LaTeX ``.tex`` always, compiled to PDF when a TeX engine is available.
* **Combined bundle** — one ``.zip`` (or one multi-sheet ``.xlsx`` workbook, Step
  D8.2) of all of the above for archive / hand-off.
* **Export scope (Step D8.3)** — the fuselage/tail sbeam artifacts and the case
  index can be filtered to the Critical Loads tab's governing-case selection;
  wing and control-surface exports always include the full set (see the "Export
  scope" section's caption for why).

Nothing here depends on persisted result slices, so the exports always reflect the
current inputs. Channels whose inputs are absent are shown as disabled with a note.
