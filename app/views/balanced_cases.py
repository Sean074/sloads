"""Streamlit page for the balanced free-free airplane cases (plan 11 B2-B6).

One page of the multi-page app; run the suite with:  streamlit run app/Home.py

The mission's aim 2: a full airplane balanced case -- wing tip to wing tip, nose
to tail -- that needs no constraint because the loads balance. This page shows,
per case, the two numbers an engineer needs in order to trust it: **how far out
of balance the physics actually came** (the residual, before any correction) and
**how much was relieved to close it**. Those are the deliverable's honesty
statement, which is why they are columns here rather than a log line.
