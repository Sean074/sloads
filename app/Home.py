"""sloads — multipage entrypoint.

Run with:  streamlit run app/Home.py

This file is now **only what is specific to this front-end**: its page set, its
sidebar grouping, and its one ``st.set_page_config``. Everything shared with the
second GUI (design note 32) lives in :mod:`app_shell` — the project in session
state and its unsaved-changes guard (:mod:`app_shell.project_state`), the units
toggle and project-file widget (:mod:`app_shell.sidebar`), the page scaffold and
unit boundary (:mod:`app_shell.components`).

The whole app is one reloadable ``project.json`` carried in ``st.session_state``.
Navigation is built explicitly from :mod:`sloads.workflow` (the single source of
truth for the step graph) and grouped into a **Start** app-shell section plus the
six analysis-flow phases the user moves through left-to-right (Step G2):

    Start ──▶ 1 · Develop V-n diagram ──▶ 2 · Flight loads ──▶ 3 · Other loads ──▶
    4 · Landing loads ──▶ 5 · Load-case plotting ──▶ 6 · Export

Using ``st.navigation`` (rather than the implicit ``pages/`` directory) means page
order and titles come from the workflow metadata, not filename numbers -- so there
is no numeric-prefix coupling and no duplicate-index collisions. A section with no
steps is omitted from the sidebar rather than shown empty.

Navigation is deliberately *not* shared shell: this GUI shows every workflow step,
while the oracle GUI shows only the steps backed by an original ``.BAS`` program
(note 32, OG-2), so the two derive their page sets from the same ``workflow.py``
by different rules.
