## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.2] — 2026-09-08

### Added

- **Appendix A is the balanced V-n condition register (design note 44 §23, tier L, 2026-09-07).**
  Every balanced flight condition the envelope produces — 80 rows on
  `ga6_normal`, 180 on `baron_58`, 200 on `concept_regional_jet` — reproducing
  Ref 1 Appendix A p179 (the mass cases) and p180-185 (the balanced-flight
  columns), with the manual's per-block `FOR CG1 FS= … WL= …` headings turned
  into CG, configuration and altitude columns so the table is flat. The document
  named 23 critical conditions and never showed the reader the 80, 180 or 200
  they were selected out of; a selection whose candidate set is not published is
  a claim, not a result. The four component columns mark which rows were
  selected, and as what: `W-03`, `F-01`, `VT-01, VT-02, VT-03`.
- **`<project>_vn_conditions.csv`** ships in the export bundle and the manifest —
  the appendix as a file, all nineteen columns in one flat row, built from the
  same rows the page prints.
- **Section 2.2 gains a `CG` column**, the positional id the conditions are
  indexed by, so a reader meeting `CG1` in Appendix A can find `fwd gross` in
  Section 2. One owner, `cg_cases.flight_case_ids`; the case *name* remains the
  identity everywhere else.
- **`NX` is printed beside `DX`** in the conditions table — the inertia drag
  factor `−DX/W` the drag leaves the balance as. The appendix states in one
  paragraph that thrust is not modelled and why the airplane is nonetheless in
  longitudinal equilibrium.

- **An applied-load CSV per surface (note 44 §18 OR-141a, tier L, 2026-09-07).**
  `fuselage_applied_loads.csv`, `htail_applied_loads.csv` and
  `vtail_applied_loads.csv` join `wing_applied_loads.csv` in the export bundle and on
  the Export page, each carrying its component's whole applied set — the case, the
  point the load acts at, all six body-axis components and the factor. One file per
  surface rather than one airframe file with a component column: a consumer loads the
  surface they are sizing, and a single file would have to be filtered before it could
  be used. The file and its appendix are the same rows through the same owner, and
  **G-OR-90** holds both to the cards the deck writes.

- **Appendix C is split into C.1 applied and C.2 carried (note 44 §18 OR-144, tier L,
  2026-09-07).** On the reasoning that split Appendix B and was never the wing's alone:
  the load applied at a station and the load carried across it are different quantities,
  and a reader who takes one for the other builds the wrong model. They shared one
  table, with the distinction carried by a sentence in a note.

- **The oracle report gains sections 7, 8 and 9 — aileron, flap and tab (note 44 §19
  OR-147, tier L, 2026-09-07).** Each states the critical condition, the load it
  produces and the pressure to apply, over the surface Section 2 already draws. They
  add **no appendix, no station table and no CSV**: the A–E pattern exists because a
  wing, a body and a tail deliver a distributed load a structures model integrates
  station by station, and a control surface delivers a pressure the reader applies.
  **G-OR-95** holds the appendix set at A–E, so "no appendix" is a checked property of
  the document rather than an intention.

- **Two figures per section: how to apply the load, and where (OR-153).** The chordwise
  application diagram draws the profile against the fraction of the surface's local
  chord, with the hinge line and the point the resultant acts at marked; it is built
  from the module's own profile, so it exists on every project that runs the module.
  The planform locator shades the surface on its host, drawn from Section 2's entered
  outlines through the same owner §2.1 uses. Where an outline is not entered the
  locator states the absence — measured, that is the flap and the elevator on three of
  the four examples — and says in the same breath that the loads and pressures are
  unaffected, because they are computed from the entered areas and not from a shape.

- **The spanwise distribution is stated, where the oracle leaves it ambiguous
  (OR-151).** The pressure is uniform along the span and the chordwise profile is in
  fractions of the *local* surface chord. That is not an assumption added by the
  document: each of the three equations divides a load by an **area**, so the pressure
  is uniform over that area by construction. **G-OR-97** holds the printed profile to
  it — mean pressure times the entered area is the printed load, on every case of every
  shipped example — so a future edit cannot move the profile or the area without the
  other.

- **One sign convention, in the same words in all three (OR-150).** Pressure is
  positive acting normal to the control surface's own plane, in the sense a
  trailing-edge-down deflection produces; a positive pressure gives a nose-down moment
  about the hinge line and a negative pressure, which a trailing-edge-up throw produces,
  gives a trailing-edge-down moment about it. The airplane axis that normal is belongs
  to the host — `z` for a wing- or horizontal-tail-borne surface, `y` for a rudder — and
  is named rather than left to the reader.

- **Section 11, One Engine Inoperative (design note 44 §21, tier L, 2026-09-07).**
  The oracle report's eleventh section, in three subsections: 11.1 Input Data,
  11.2 Critical Cases and 11.3 Yaw Transient. The third exists because this is
  the suite's only time-marching analysis — every other condition is a state of
  the airplane, this one is an event — and a peak load stated without the march
  that produced it is a number a reader cannot check. 11.3 carries one pair of
  figures per case, the yaw response and the fin load that recovered it, each
  marking 23.367(b)'s two-second limit on corrective action and the instant of
  peak total load; a symmetric installation's second engine is not re-plotted,
  and the section says so.
- **The 23.367 engine-failure cases are fin design conditions (note 44 OR-172,
  tier L, 2026-09-07).** Every recovered case now joins the vertical tail's
  critical set and travels with it: Section 6, the chordwise and spanwise
  distributions, the applied-load appendix and the exported v-tail deck.
  `one_engine_out.fin_conditions` publishes them and `select.default_critical`
  admits them at one insertion point.
- **A `NOT_APPLICABLE` section state (note 44 OR-178).** The airplane has no such
  condition — distinct from the tool not producing it and from the inputs being
  missing. Its reason is read from `applicability.step_not_applicable`, the
  predicate the module refuses on and the coverage table cites.

- **Section 10, Engine Mount Loads, in the oracle report (note 44 §20, tier L,
  2026-09-07).** Two subsections. **10.1 Input Data** states the entered engine
  and propeller data one column per engine, the three stations in play — the
  beam model's mount node, its hub node and the combined engine + propeller CG
  the loads act at — the thrust axis as direction cosines, the case list by
  regulation, and the sign convention. **10.2 Critical Cases** states all six
  airplane-axis components of the load each condition applies to the airframe,
  one row per case per engine, and beside it the torque about the engine's own
  thrust line and the thrust along it — the two scalars the six were resolved
  from, so a reader can repeat the resolution rather than take it. Every case is
  LIMIT with its factor stated and applied nowhere; the section adds no appendix,
  because a mount takes a point load and not a distribution.

- **Three views of the engine installation, drawing whatever airframe the project
  enters (note 44 §20 OR-168/OR-169).** Side, front and plan, each with the
  fuselage from its section table, the wing and the empennage through the owners
  Section 2 and the three-view sketch already use, and every engine's mount node,
  hub node, application point and thrust line marked on it. A project that enters
  no outline still gets all three: the engines are the subject and the airframe
  is context. `derived_geometry.fuselage_outline` is the new single owner of the
  drawn body — the section table had been in the schema since the schema had a
  body, and nothing drew it.

- **`export/coordinates.engine_thrust_axis` and `engine_applied_load`**, the one
  owner of an engine's thrust line and of the airplane-axis resolution of the
  torque and thrust that act about it. `CONVENTIONS.md` §1 already makes this
  module the single edit point for every axis resolution in the suite; the report
  asks it rather than restating its signs, the same shape OR-146 gave the fin's
  torsion.

- **The engine's thrust line is an input (design note 53, tier L, 2026-09-07).**
  `EngineInput.thrust_line_aft` and `thrust_line_fwd` state the line as two
  points in the airplane frame, with `(0, 0, 0)` meaning not entered — the
  sentinel `LandingGearInput.attach` already uses. The forward point is forward
  **because it is entered as such**, never inferred from the smaller fuselage
  station, so a pusher installation is expressible with no special case
  anywhere. Both or neither: one point alone states no direction and is refused
  by name, as are two points that coincide. An engine that states no line is resolved about the
  airplane's forward axis and marked **ASSUMED** on every deliverable that prints
  it. Entered on the Engine Mount page, drawn on the Configuration & Layout
  three-view and on the oracle report's three views of the installation.

- **The propeller's rotation direction is an input, per engine
  (`EngineInput.prop_direction`).** Clockwise seen from the pilot's seat by
  default — what every published torque already assumed — so no existing project
  moves by a pound-foot. A counter-clockwise engine reverses the sign of every
  torque it delivers to the airframe, in every deliverable that carries one. Per
  engine rather than per airplane, because a counter-rotating twin is the
  configuration the field exists for. It reuses `RotorDirection`, which the
  schema has carried on `Rotor` since the turbine rotor model and which nothing
  read until now.

- **`derived_geometry.engine_thrust_segments`**, the one producer of an engine's
  thrust line as something to draw, read by both three-view consumers so they
  cannot disagree about where a line runs or how long an assumed one is. The
  length of an assumed line is a fraction of the body, not of the plot, so the
  same engine draws the same line in the report and in the GUI.

- **The GA6 example carries its printed Appendix A empennage (tier L, 2026-08-30).**
  `examples/ga6_normal.project.json` gains horizontal tail, vertical tail, elevator, rudder
  and flap entries in `geometry.surfaces`, transcribed from the coordinate tables Appendix A
  prints for each (p145 flap, p149 rudder, p151 h-tail, p153 elevator, p157 tab). The
  fixture had kept those WINGGEOM runs' **outputs** as scalars and dropped their **inputs**.
  Every entered polyline reproduces its own printed AREA/SIDE, MAC, YLE(MAC), XLE(MAC) and
  aspect ratio to within **0.084 %**. The GA6 tail therefore stops being an assumed
  rectangle: its spanwise strip distribution, its deck and its LRA beam model now describe
  the surface the manual drew.

- **The oracle report states the fuselage loads (#151 iteration 4, design note 44
  §13/§15, tier L, 2026-09-06).** Section 4, in five subsections and Appendix C,
  built from the `fuselage_loads` step (`NETLOADS`, Reference 1 Ch 15 p103):
  4.1 the fuselage beam and where its mass came from, 4.2 the run register and
  the notation, 4.3 the manual's own **CRITICAL FUSELAGE LOADS** summary
  (Appendix A p198, all seven blocks), 4.4 the closure of the beam and the
  wing-attach fitting loads, 4.5 the distributions. Appendix C carries every case
  at every station, as a view of `sbeam_bridge.body_span_load_csv`'s own rows
  rather than a second assembler. Every load is LIMIT, states the factor
  14 CFR 23.303 prescribes for its case, and is multiplied by nothing.

- **`body_loads` publishes the four critical fuselage conditions it had been
  discarding (design note 44 §15 OR-108, tier L, 2026-09-06).**
  `select_fuselage` had always computed blocks 1, 2, 3 and 7 of p198;
  `run()` returned `ModuleResult(conditions=[])` and threw them away, so the
  oracle GUI's Fuselage Loads page printed *"Body Loads produced no
  conditions."* beside a full station table where the manual prints its summary,
  and every other component page showed its critical cases. One `ModuleResult`
  now feeds the GUIs, the CLI, `load_cases_csv` and report section 4 through
  renderers that were already generic.

- **SELECT publishes the unbalanced pitching moment about the CG (design note 44
  §15 OR-111, tier L, 2026-09-06).** The one field of p198 with no owner in this
  project, and not reconstructible from the printed page by inspection — the arm
  closes against neither the 25 % nor the 50 % MAC until the balanced elevator
  load is subtracted. Recovered from `SELECT.BAS` 5210/5262/5410/5560, cited in
  `docs/20_theory/00_theory_sources.md`, and verified against the printed page on
  both cases (+243,203.9 against a printed 243203.5; −43,169.9 against
  −43170.23). The sign asymmetry between the unchecked and checked forms is the
  original's and is ported as found.

- **The methods statement declares the p198 tail-station deviation (G-OR-70,
  tier M, 2026-09-06).** `report/methods.APPROVED_CORRECTIONS` gains the OR-112
  entry, so every stamped CSV, deck and report states it in band. The register is
  the authority and the guard reads the register, which is what caught the
  omission the moment the entry was approved.

- **The oracle report states the horizontal tail's loads (#151 iteration 5,
  design note 44 §17, tier L, 2026-09-07).** Section 5, in five subsections and
  Appendix D, built from the `tail_loads` step (`TAILDIST`, Reference 1 Ch 10):
  5.1 the surface, its elevator and the loads reference axis the distributed
  loads are stated about, 5.2 the design conditions and the search that produced
  them, 5.3 the critical loads with the aerodynamic state each was computed at,
  5.4 the chordwise pressure distribution and its figure, 5.5 the spanwise loads
  on the beam. Appendix D carries every condition's **applied** load at every
  station, in airplane axes, as a view of `sbeam_bridge.tail_span_csv`'s own
  rows rather than a second assembler; what the structure carries is stated at
  the root, where it is greatest. Every table keys on the case reference
  (`HT-01`), every load is LIMIT, states the factor 14 CFR 23.303 prescribes for
  its condition, and is multiplied by nothing.

- **The tail is two sections, and G-OR-2 becomes a partition (design note 44 §17
  OR-128/OR-129, tier L, 2026-09-06).** An analyst reads by surface, so the
  horizontal tail is section 5 and the vertical tail section 6, and everything
  below them renumbers — free, because `section_number` derives from position
  and no cross-reference is written as a literal. One step across two sections
  breaks the old one-step-one-section rule, so the rule becomes *one step, one
  declared partition*, keyed on `component`: **every published condition lands
  in exactly one section**, asserted in both directions, which is a stronger
  gate than the counting one it replaces.

- **Every critical tail condition states the load its control surface carries
  (design note 44 §17 OR-132, tier L, 2026-09-06).** `elevator_load` was
  published on 2 of 9 horizontal-tail conditions and `load_on_rudder` on 2 of 4
  vertical-tail ones, so section 5.2's table would have had a blank
  control-surface column on seven rows for no reason the analysis could give:
  both are pure functions of the 25 %/50 % split every one of those conditions
  already carries. Published in `_htail_condition`, the one constructor they all
  pass through, rather than at nine call sites. Second **OR-15 admission** over
  frozen `sloads/modules/select.py`; additive, and the one insertion that would
  have moved an existing CSV column was rewritten to append instead.

- **The oracle technical report: the report page, the report spec and the issue package (note 44 §7–§9, tier L, 2026-08-30).**
  The oracle GUI gains a **Report** page — the one page of that front end that is
  not a workflow step — which edits a report specification and builds an **issue
  package**: a directory holding `report.tex`, the `report.json` the page edits,
  a `build.json` as-built stamp, a copy of `project.json`, and a `MANIFEST.txt`
  that meets `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §4.7 in both directions. Iteration 1 delivers
  the front matter — cover, abstract, contents, list of figures, list of tables
  and §1 Introduction — with every derived analysis section already present as a
  stated placeholder, so the derived-section gate holds from the first commit
  rather than the last.
  New owners: `ReportSpec` + `REPORT_SCHEMA_VERSION` (`sloads/models/report.py`),
  the provenance fingerprint and anchors (`sloads/report/fingerprint.py`), the
  content model and its four section states (`sloads/report/oracle_content.py`),
  the document's furniture (`sloads/report/oracle_latex.py`), the package member
  list and manifest (`sloads/report/oracle_package.py`), and the package writer
  (`sloads/export/report_package.py`). The report's content rules accrue in the
  new `docs/10_standard/ORACLE_REPORT.md`.
  The page chooses **where** packages are written with the operating system's own
  folder dialog (`sloads/export/directory_dialog.py`) — reachable because the
  oracle GUI runs locally, so the machine serving the page is the machine the
  user is at — with an in-app folder browser as the fallback for a machine that
  has no dialog. A folder that this process cannot write to is reported when it
  is chosen, not when the build fails: choosing a folder on macOS is not being
  granted it.

- **Section 2.1 of the oracle technical report draws its planform figures (note 44 OR-45,
  tier M, 2026-08-31).** One to-scale figure per main surface — wing, horizontal tail,
  vertical tail — showing the entered leading- and trailing-edge polylines as a closed
  outline with the control surfaces that live on it filled on top, each region labelled
  with the area the table beside it already prints. OR-45 promised the figures with the
  tables in iteration 2 and only the tables shipped; this is the other half. New owner:
  `sloads/report/planform_tex.py`, a TikZ emitter dispatched by figure key from
  `plots_tex.figure_body_tex`. Drawn on `axis equal image` — a swept tapered surface on
  independent axes is a different shape from the one the loads were computed for — with
  the butt-line surfaces spanwise-across and the station axis reversed, so a 402-inch wing
  fits a page and still reads nose-up in the airplane's own stations. Regions are told
  apart by fill density, never colour (`SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §4.3), and the vertical tail is
  drawn in the fuselage-station/waterline plane and never mirrored: the frame decides that,
  not `SurfaceInput.symmetric`, which `examples/baron_58.project.json` sets `true` on its
  fin. **No hinge line is drawn**, and the caption says why: the suite carries a control
  surface's areas forward and aft of its hinge as scalars and no hinge geometry, so a line
  would be an inference printed with the standing of entered geometry. It arrives with #156.
  Figures stay **source, not images** — `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §2's image prohibition, which
  the 2026-08-30 *Data reference* amendment reaffirmed verbatim, is unchanged and a polygon
  costs nothing to keep it.

- **Section 2 of the oracle technical report — Loads Configuration (note 44 OR-38…OR-44,
  tier L, 2026-08-30).** The report's first analysis section: 2.1 Geometry, 2.2 Weight and
  Mass Properties, 2.3 Structural Design Speeds, 2.4 Flight Envelope, grouped as
  subsections of one numbered section so every workflow step keeps exactly one home
  (G-OR-2 unchanged). 2.3 prints each design speed and limit load factor beside the
  FAR 23 minimum computed for it, with no compliance verdict — that is the reviewer's
  finding. 2.4 draws one V-n diagram per loading and altitude block, the boundary a
  polyline through the design points FLTLOADS produced, with gust cases marked
  separately and VA/VC/VD as reference lines. New owners: `sloads/report/oracle_sections.py`
  (one content builder per step key), `oracle_content.DOCUMENT_TITLES` (the document
  names its own sections rather than borrowing the GUI's navigation labels) and
  `oracle_content.SECTION_GROUPS` (grouping declared as data, members guarded contiguous).

- **Section 2 states the configuration in full (note 44 OR-45…OR-47, tier L, 2026-08-30).**
  2.1 carries one table per surface — wing planform, horizontal tail and elevator, vertical
  tail and rudder, aileron, flap, and each trim tab — with areas, planform figures, tail arm
  stations and control deflections. 2.2 adds the weight and centre-of-gravity cases: name,
  role, weight, Xcg, Zcg and analysis, under a note explaining which load families each
  analysis tag feeds and which of the landing analysis's three positional loadings a ground
  case's role supplies. These are the first values the report reads from the project rather
  than from a `ModuleResult`, so the section states once that they are the configuration as
  entered, and the G-OR-3 guard was widened from "every number came from a result" to "every
  number came from a result or from the project as entered, and none is invented".

- **Section 2.4 opens with the speed and altitude envelope (tier M, 2026-08-31).**
  The oracle report's §2.4 gains, ahead of its V-n diagrams, the operating envelope in speed
  and altitude: V(MC), V(MNE) and V(MD) from **sea level** to the maximum operating altitude,
  each constant in equivalent airspeed below the shoulder altitude and Mach-limited above it,
  with Vh marked at sea level where it is entered. The Mach-limited half is tabulated beside
  it from MACHLIM's own `ModuleResult`. The V-n diagrams are slices of this envelope, so the
  envelope now comes before its cuts. The figure has **one builder**,
  `report.content.speed_altitude_plot_data`, shared with the summary report (OR-7) — so the
  summary report's speed/altitude figure now begins at sea level and marks Vh in place of
  starting at the shoulder altitude.

- **The oracle report states the vertical tail's loads (note 44 §17, tier L, 2026-09-07).**
  Section 6, *Vertical Tail and Rudder Loads*, in five subsections mirroring section 5 —
  the surface and its loads reference axis, the four design conditions of 14 CFR
  23.441(a)(1)/(2)/(3) and 23.443(b) with the method that selected them, the critical
  loads with the rudder load on every one of them, the chordwise pressure distribution,
  and the spanwise loads at the root — plus **Appendix E**, the vertical tail's
  applied-load deck (`Case | GID | X | Y | Z | Fy | SF`) in airplane axes from the same
  mapper the exported deck uses. One builder produces sections 5 and 6 with the surface
  as a parameter, so the two are the same analysis read twice rather than two copies
  kept in step. Every load is LIMIT and states the 14 CFR 23.303 factor it has not been
  multiplied by.

- **The report withholds the vertical tail's spanwise loads on a non-conventional tail
  (note 44 OR-133/OR-134/OR-133a, tier L, 2026-09-07).** sloads models the empennage as
  a conventional tail; on a T-tail, cruciform or V-tail the fin is additionally the
  horizontal tail's supporting structure in the sense of 23.427(a), and that path is not
  modelled. Section 6.5 and Appendix E render the stated state under **"Not supported"**
  and no table; 6.2's condition register and 6.3's summary state that the set is short a
  condition and **name it**; 6.1's loads-reference-axis stations still print, because
  they are geometry, with the reason in the table's own note. Section 5, 6.3's totals,
  6.4 and Appendix D are unaffected, gated by diff. **The withholding is the report's
  only** — the calc, the decks, the CLI and the GUI are untouched, so the balanced
  deck's lateral cases still assemble on all three shipped T-tails.

- **Section 2.2 draws the weight and centre-of-gravity envelope (note 44 OR-45 / note 45 WE-8, tier M, 2026-08-31).**
  The oracle report's §2.2 gains the figure the manual prints at Appendix A p140,
  *"USEFUL LOAD ENVELOPE AND STRUCTURAL LIMITS"*: both loading edges swept from the
  minimum flight weight, the closed structural CG-limit envelope, and every entered
  weight/CG case marked — cases sharing a point sharing one marker and both names. The
  plotted vertices are tabulated beside it, weight, station and waterline, read from
  WTENV's own `ModuleResult` rather than re-swept. The figure has **one builder**,
  `report.content.weight_cg_plot_data`, shared with the summary report (OR-7), so the
  summary report's weight/CG figure gains the aft edge and the closed limit envelope in
  place of its three vertical limit rules. `report.oracle_content.run_sections` now runs
  a step's **folded** modules as well as its primary one, keyed by module name —
  `sloads.workflow.step_modules` owns that set — so a page whose `bas` names three
  programs can report from all three without a second run point.

- **The oracle report gains Section 3, Wing Loads, and Appendix B (tier L, 2026-09-01).**
  The report's first load-bearing section: 3.1 the wing data the cases were run from — the
  loads reference axis (station table plus a planform figure with the axis drawn on it), the
  Schrenk span load `c*cl` at `CL = 0`, `1.0` and the airplane's own `CLmax`, and the
  airplane-less-tail lift and moment curves with every balanced condition marked on them;
  3.2 the run register of selected cases with speed, altitude, weight, CG case and 14 CFR
  paragraph, plus the axes and sign convention, **what the searched V-n matrix enumerates**
  (every combination of configuration, weight/CG case, altitude and condition — a V-n diagram
  states none of those) and **where the case list came from**: the critical-load selection's
  own search, or a case list entered on the project, which wins when present. Where it is
  entered, every condition the selection names is tabulated against whether it was run. It also
  states that `Nz` is the inertia load factor (so a +3.8 g case prints as −3.8) and says, from
  the analysed set, whether that set holds a negative-load-factor condition at all; 3.3 the root loads of every case; 3.4 the net
  distributions of `Sz`, `Mxx`, `Myy` and `Sx` along the span, every selected case on one
  axes. **Appendix B** carries the same distributions station by station, in two parts:
  **B.1 the applied loads** — the point each load acts at (`X`, `Y`, `Z`) and the `Fz`, `Fx`
  and free `Myy` applied there, which is a deck a structural model can be built from directly
  — and **B.2 the loads carried**, the cumulative `Sz`, `Sx`, `Mxx` and `Myy` that model
  should return. The applied moment is the **free** moment, never a difference of the
  cumulative column: most of that difference is the outboard shear carried across the bay's
  sweep and dihedral, which a model generates for itself. Section 3.2 gains a **notation
  table** — every symbol with its units and whether it is an applied increment or a cumulative
  load — and writes out the recurrences that build one from the other. Each appendix starts a
  fresh page, and Appendix B is landscape.

  **Every load the section delivers is ULTIMATE and carries the `-ULT` marker; every input
  distribution is LIMIT and says so.** Section 2 satisfied G-OR-4 by carrying no force or
  moment at all; section 3 satisfies it by marking every one of them.

  The **Appendix A input echo now holds a reserved slot** that renders its "not yet
  implemented" state, so Wing Loads is Appendix B from the first build rather than being
  lettered A today and renumbered when the echo lands. A reserved slot is lettered but not
  referable — prose points only at a built appendix.

- **Section 12, Landing Gear Loads — the analysis body is complete (design note 44 §22, tier L, 2026-09-07).**
  The oracle report's last derived section, and the first since Section 2 that all
  three shipped reports carry. Three subsections: the gear geometry with the
  manual's own `K` / `GAMMA` / ground-angle / `AP`-`BP`-`DP`-`CP` lever-arm table
  (Appendix A p230, reproduced to the printed figures), the LGFACTOR load factor
  with the drop-test estimate printed beside the pair the reactions ran at, and
  every one of the 33 FAR Part 23 ground conditions. `IMPLEMENTED` now covers the
  whole of `analysis_steps()`.
- **Appendix F — landing gear loads by case (OR-188).** The gear's applied set:
  one row per case per loaded leg, all 33 conditions, at the point that case's
  reaction acts at — the axle or the ground contact point, per design note 39's
  own owner. The first appendix indexed by case rather than by station.
- **Three ground-attitude figures (OR-189).** Appendix A prints two (p234's
  three-wheel level landing, p235's braked roll); sloads computes three
  attitudes, so the third is drawn. Each carries its ground angle, its axle
  state, the wheels at their contact patches and the CG the lever arms are taken
  about — and, which the manual leaves to the reader, the LANDLOAD cases that use
  that geometry: 1-6 and 10-12 level, 7-9 tail-down, 13-33 ground roll.
- **An applied-load CSV for every structural element (OR-186).** The landing gear
  and the engine mount join the wing, fuselage and both tails: `case`, load
  application point, all six components in the global frame, and `SF`, each file
  free to carry the columns its element needs beside the common spine.

- **The applied wing load set is an export, not just an appendix (OR-64, tier M,
  2026-09-03).** `export.sbeam_bridge.applied_load_rows` /
  `applied_load_csv` publish the loads a structures model is built from — `Fz`,
  `Fx` and the section free moment `Myy free` at each strip's own point, plus one
  row per concentrated wing mass at its own coordinates — as
  `wing_applied_loads.csv`, ULTIMATE, in the solver unit channel, with its
  torsion axis and per-case `SF` in-band. Offered as **Download applied load
  set** on the Wing Loads page (stated about the wing's loads reference axis,
  like the Export page's) and carried in the Export bundle with its own manifest
  row. The applied moment is the **free** moment, never the increment of the
  cumulative `Myy`: the two carry different physics and differ in sign on
  `ga6_normal` PHAA's inboard strips, because `ΔMyy` includes the sweep and
  dihedral transfer of outboard shear that a model applying these forces at these
  coordinates regenerates for itself.
- **The oracle report's Appendix B.1 is now a view of that one owner (OR-64,
  tier M, 2026-09-03).** The table and the downloadable file are assembled from
  the same list and gated against each other row for row, so the appendix a
  stress analyst reads and the deck they build cannot disagree about what is
  applied.

- **WTENV computes both edges of the loading envelope (design note 45, tier L, 2026-08-31, issue #157).**
  `WTENV.BAS` sorts the discretionary weight items by fuselage station, sweeps them
  cumulatively from the minimum flight weight, then re-sorts in the opposite order and
  sweeps again — one subroutine (`GOSUB 657`) called twice, printing a **forward** and an
  **aft** edge. The port emitted the ascending sweep alone. Both edges now come from one
  direction-taking sweep, each vertex carrying the weight, station **and waterline** the
  original prints, and both are oracle-locked to Appendix A p139 — all 16 printed rows on
  all three printed columns, within ±0.1 %. The aft edge is a new
  `ConditionResult` appended after the four that existed; nothing that existed changed, and
  the ballast reference selection still reads the forward edge alone, so no delivered load,
  load factor, CG case or balanced condition moves. `sloads.modules.weight_envelope`
  gains the public `loading_envelope(project, aft=...)` and the `EnvelopeVertex` triple;
  `loading_envelope_points` stays as its station-only projection for existing callers.
  WTENV's summary shape (`report.render.weight_station_rows`) gains a **Waterline** column,
  shown only for a result set that has one.

### Changed

- **The reserved "Input echo" appendix is retired, not relettered (design note 44 OR-194, tier L, 2026-09-07).**
  A project
  file is already an exact, machine-readable echo of the inputs; a table
  transcribing it is a second copy that can disagree with the first, so the
  document names the file instead. Slot A was *filled* rather than vacated, so
  Appendices B through F did not move — which is the outcome the reservation
  (note 44 OR-50) existed to protect.
- **`VnPoint.case_ref` becomes `VnPoint.case_refs`, a list** (schema 63 → 64,
  identity hop). A V-n point is routinely selected as the source of more than one
  critical condition and the single slot kept only the last write.
- **`aero_curves.inertia_drag_factor` is the one owner of `NX = −DX/W`**,
  replacing the two spellings in `modules/select.py` and
  `modules/wing_inertia.py`. No delivered number moves.
- **One OR-15 admission** (note 44 OR-203, granted 2026-09-07), scoped to
  `modules/select.py` (two lines, one import) and `modules/wing_inertia.py` (one
  line, one import). No arithmetic is touched and no delivered number moves — the
  frozen Imperial digests are unchanged, which is the measurement that says so.
  Both files are re-pinned with the scope recorded beside the hash.

- **One column set for every applied appendix (note 44 §18 OR-139/OR-140/OR-141, tier L,
  2026-09-07).** B.1 (wing), C.1 (fuselage), D (horizontal tail) and E (vertical tail)
  print `Case | Station | GID | X | Y | Z | Fx | Fy | Fz | Mx | My | Mz | SF`, in
  airplane axes, right-handed about CID 0. A reader who has learnt one applied appendix
  has learnt all four, and a heading cannot drift between them because there is one
  place it is written. `AppliedLoad` gains a `component` and `applied_loads` becomes the
  one entry point with a producer per component, so the appendix, the CSV and the deck
  are three views of one list — four assemblers of one load set is what let D and E
  diverge from the deck unnoticed.

- **The structural zeros are printed, and the note names the producer each one lacks
  (note 44 §18 OR-140, tier L, 2026-09-07).** This supersedes OR-61, which omitted `Fy`
  from B.1 because "a column of zeros in a deck reads as a measured zero". The reasoning
  stands everywhere else and keeps its reach over the results tables; the remedy was
  wrong for an appendix that is a deck, whose reader is writing FORCE/MOMENT cards and
  cannot tell an omitted column from a zero one. The export channel had already ruled
  this way for the same data. Until now B.1 printed six components and explained the
  zeros while D and E omitted them and explained the omission: two policies for one
  question, one chapter apart.

- **Appendix B.2 and section 3.4 state chord bending (design note 47, tier L, 2026-09-03).**
  `Mzz` was left out of the report's cumulative appendix as "not delivered by
  this analysis" and out of its distribution figures as a load nobody reads off
  a plot. Neither was true: it is computed for every case, oracle-locked at the
  root (Appendix A p222), printed by `wing_span_loads.csv`, printed at the root
  by 3.3, and named by the closure gate the appendix is written under — and at
  the root it *exceeds* the torsion beside it on four of the five example cases
  (`ga6_normal` ACRL, 86,959 against 48,244 lb-in). B.2 gains it as a fifth
  column and 3.2 gains its recurrence `Mzz(i) = Mzz(i+1) + Sx(i+1) dy`
  (**OR-71**, superseding note 46's OR-70); 3.4 gains a fifth figure and the
  figure set is tied to the column set by gate, so a further column cannot
  arrive unplotted by omission rather than by decision (**OR-72**, superseding
  note 44's OR-55 on this point). B.2's note now restates that its moments are
  the beam's own positive-magnitude integrals — `Mzz` being the negation of a
  body-axis `Mz` — rather than only pointing at the notation table, because the
  reader B.2 is written for looks a number up and B.1's `Mz` is identically zero
  (**OR-73**). No calculated value changes: a column the result already carried
  becomes a column that is printed.

- **The wing carry-through is entered as a fuselage station (design note 50, tier L, 2026-09-05).**
  `SurfaceInput.front_spar_pct`/`.rear_spar_pct` are replaced by
  `front_spar_x_in`/`rear_spar_x_in` — the station itself, in the geometry page's
  length channel (**schema v60 → v61**). A chord fraction is taken on the
  centreline root chord while the wing-attach fittings are at the fuselage, so on
  a swept or cranked wing no value of the fraction could express the station:
  `ga6_normal`'s MAC leading edge sits 18.6 in aft of its root leading edge, which
  is also why %MAC was ruled out as an entry unit (20 % root chord is 2.28 %MAC
  there) and why the stored datum is a global X that does not migrate when
  somebody refines the planform (OR-121, OR-126).
- **A blank spar station derives, and says so on the page (design note 50, tier L, 2026-09-05).**
  The pair is a note 36 collapsed override — blank derives, typed overrides — so
  the geometry page states the station the analysis will actually use
  (*"Blank — derives from 20 % of the root chord (currently 65.20 in). Enter a
  value only to override."*) without writing it into the project. Accepting the
  estimate therefore stays visibly an assumption: `CarryThrough.assumed` is True
  exactly when nobody entered a station, and a page visit cannot promote a
  derived station to an entered one (OR-123, OR-126).
- **The assumed carry-through moves to 20 % / 60 % of the root chord (design note 50, tier L, 2026-09-05).**
  From 15 % / 65 %, in `constants.DEFAULT_FRONT_SPAR_PCT`/`_REAR_SPAR_PCT`, which
  are now the estimator for an unentered station rather than a stored input's
  fallback. On `ga6_normal` the carry-through moves from x = 60.15–110.65 in to
  65.20–105.60 in and the front fitting load moves −1.5 % / −11.6 % / −10.6 % /
  −4.2 % across the four fuselage conditions; `baron_58` moves further (−25.9 %
  to −33.4 %). **No printed oracle moves** — Ch 15 ships none — so the acceptance
  is the module's own equilibrium-closure gates, re-run and green, and the
  Imperial baseline is regenerated in the body channels only (OR-122).

- **A disagreement between two entered areas is stated, not resolved silently (note 44
  §19 OR-152, tier L, 2026-09-07).** The area a control surface's loads are run on and
  the area its entered outline encloses are two different inputs, and they disagree on
  three of the four examples: the aileron's drawn outline is 4 % under its analysis area
  on `baron_58`, 5 % over on `cessna_210` and **44 % under** on
  `concept_regional_jet`. The printed pressure is the module's, computed from the
  analysis area; past 2 % the section says so, in both directions, and leaves which one
  is the airplane to the configuration. A figure that had shaded the outline and divided
  the load by it would have printed a pressure 77 % high on the regional jet for a load
  nothing had changed.

- **A tab is drawn on its control surface, not on the fixed one (OR-149, OR-155).** A
  tab is cut into an elevator, a rudder or an aileron, so that is what the locator draws
  it on. No tab planform is entered anywhere in the schema, so the rectangle is the
  entered area at the entered station — chord `MACTAB`, span `STAB/MACTAB`, trailing
  edge on the host's — and the caption says so in as many words. A shape a reader could
  mistake for entered geometry is what this document must not draw silently.

- **The flap prints the set its pick came from (OR-156).** The critical flap load is the
  largest of four 23.345(a) conditions — `ga6_normal` prints 212 / 425 / 629 / 625 lb,
  and that the last two are within 1 % is content a reader is owed. Where no engine
  record carries take-off power and a propeller diameter the 23.457(b) slipstream case
  does not exist, and the section states that condition with its consequence rather than
  printing a quietly smaller number.

- **ONENGOUT fails every engine, not the selected one (note 44 OR-173, tier L,
  2026-09-07).** One engine's failure loads the fin in one sense; a fin is sized
  for both. Each entered engine whose failure produces a yawing moment is now
  marched in turn and carries its own case ID and its own sign. No case is a
  mirror of another — on an asymmetric installation the marches genuinely
  differ. `failed_engine_index` remains the selector for the single-case views.
- **An uncontrollable case is printed and excluded from the envelope (OR-174).**
  Where the march reaches its 60 s bound without recovering, the case is
  reported in full with the uncontrollability statement and a referral to the
  stability-and-control discipline, and it reaches no critical set, no
  distribution, no appendix and no deck. A load at the simulation bound is where
  the integration stopped, not a design load. On `atr42_100` and `dhc8_dash8`
  that is the VS case on both engines.
- **The already-ultimate basis rule gets one owner (`safety_factors.shared_basis_factor`).**
  Admitting 23.367(a)(2) — which the regulation prescribes ULTIMATE at SF 1.0 —
  to the fin's set makes the v-tail files *mixed*: one ultimate row among limit
  ones. A mixed file keeps plain load columns and states the basis per row in
  its `SF` cell; only an all-ultimate file carries `-ULT` (note 49 OR-118a). The
  rule was written in `report.render` and merely *assumed* in
  `export.sbeam_bridge`; both now read the one owner, and the methods stamp
  states the mixed-file case in as many words.

- **Section 10 resolves each engine's loads about its entered thrust line, not
  about a line derived from the engine CG and the hub (design note 53 D-53.3,
  superseding note 44 OR-161).** The derived axis was a line between two *mass*
  stations and inherited every error in either: measured **14.0°** off the
  airplane axis on `ga6_normal` and **71.6°** — very nearly straight up — on
  `cessna_210`, whose engine CG waterline is a filed defect. On `ga6_normal` the
  section now prints `Mx +737.34 / Mz 0` for 23.361(a)(1) and `+740.44 / 0` for
  (a)(2), where it printed `+715.32 / −178.83` and `+718.34 / −179.58`. The
  **magnitude is unchanged** — `|M|` is 737.3383 and 740.4429 either way — so
  this does not change how hard the mount is worked; it corrects which axis the
  work is about. Section 10.1 states the rotation per engine and states why the
  gyroscopic condition is exempt from it.

- **Project schema v62 → v63**, additive and an identity hop: `None` on both
  thrust-line points is exactly the v62 state, since the schema carried no thrust
  line at all, and clockwise is what every published torque already assumed.

- **Figure labels are placed clear of the lines, and axes print readable ticks (tier M, 2026-09-01).**
  Two display defects in `report.plots_tex`, the emitter behind every figure in both the
  summary report and the oracle technical report. Marker labels were all emitted directly
  above their point, so any marker near a line had its label written through it — on the GA6
  that was `Vh` on the never-exceed boundary, two CG cases on the loading edges and all four
  gust points on the V-n boundary. Each label is now placed by a rule evaluated against the
  figure's own geometry: the box the text occupies is scored for clearance from every plotted
  segment, reference line and other marker, and the first position that clears wins — so a
  label with room stays above its marker and only an obstructed one moves. Separately, an axis
  with a large range printed under a shared `·10⁴` multiplier (the speed/altitude figure's
  altitude axis read `0.5 1 1.5`); axes now print fixed ticks with thousands separators.

- **The fuselage beam states where its mass is and where the beam runs (schema
  v62, tier L, 2026-09-07).** `FuselageStation` gains `y`/`z`, the butt line and
  waterline the lumped mass acts at, blank-deriving from the weight-weighted
  centroid of the item-database masses lumped at that station. They are a
  different statement from `FuselageMassInput.ref_waterline`, which is where the
  *beam* runs: on `ga6_normal` the body mass spans waterline 52 to 105 about a
  beam at 87.7. Chapter 15 solves the body as a symmetric-flight vertical beam
  and reads neither coordinate — only the station enters its shear and bending —
  so no delivered fuselage load moves across the hop, which is additive and
  loads a v61 file bit-identical.

- **Section 4.1 draws the airplane in side view (tier L, 2026-09-07).** A station
  table answers *how much, where along the body*; it cannot answer *does this
  look like the airplane*. The figure is in the X–Z plane — the plane Chapter 15
  solves in — and carries the three things a reader checks a beam against: each
  station's mass at the waterline it acts at, labelled with that mass; the beam
  those masses are carried on; and the stations the load enters and leaves at,
  the wing carry-through's two spars and the horizontal tail's balancing load.
  Table 21 gains Y and Z beside the weight, and says which of them the analysis
  reads.

- **The case reference is the identity in every fuselage and tail table (tier M,
  2026-09-07).** The pull-up, wing-attach and tail tables drop their
  condition-name columns: `F-01` and `HT-01` are the machine identity (M4-9), and
  the name and its regulation are stated once in each section's register rather
  than repeated in four tables. The tail register gains the safety factor, so the
  factor is stated wherever a case is named.

- **Appendix C places every station on the airplane (tier M, 2026-09-07).** `X`,
  `Y` and `Z` on every row: the body beam runs down the centre plane on the
  fuselage loads reference axis, so `Y` is zero by construction and `Z` is that
  axis's waterline — the position of the structure, not of the mass it carries,
  which the beam table states separately.

- **Wing Loads and Fuselage Loads download buttons are relabelled by channel
  (#192, tier M, 2026-09-05).** *"— LIMIT (CSV)"* and *"— ULTIMATE (CSV)"*
  become *"— analysis table (CSV)"* and *"— sbeam bridge (CSV)"*: both files on
  each page have been LIMIT since note 49 OR-116, so a basis marker no longer
  tells them apart and the label names what does differ. The shared LIMIT basis
  and the unapplied 14 CFR 23.303 factor are stated once in the caption beneath
  them. File names and file contents are unchanged — the `*_ULT.csv` names stay
  stale until OR-81 retires them in 0.8.3.

- **Design note 48 records the LIMIT-channel contract, agreed (tier S, 2026-09-04).**
  Reviewing **#154** — a `ConditionResult` holding no load still carrying
  `safety_factor = 1.5`, so a geometry table prints an ULTIMATE banner — found
  the factor applied on far more surfaces than the contract's purpose requires;
  the `engine` CLI report scales a mean takeoff torque 554.4 → 831.6 ft-lb.
  `docs/40_history/48_limit_channel_note.md` states the rulings that follow
  (**OR-76 … OR-86**, gates **G-OR-44 … G-OR-48**): module analysis becomes a
  LIMIT channel while the oracle GUI, the technical report and the export deck
  stay ULTIMATE through 0.8.2; the factor is **stated, never applied** as the
  endpoint, with the last multiply removed in 0.8.3's own boundary note; LIMIT
  becomes the global default with no per-artifact marker, retiring M4-15 in
  0.8.3; and the factorless test gets one owner,
  `safety_factors.prescribes_factor` — *no load-unit value and no `case_ref`* —
  leaving the governing family table untouched. Measured, that rule is a stable
  38 conditions on both GA6 and Baron 58, with `select`'s 6 critical wing cases
  protected by the `case_ref` clause. Decisions only: no code, no schema hop, no
  frozen file touched; #154 stays open and implements inside the note.

- **Every load sloads delivers is LIMIT — stated, never applied (design note 49,
  tier L, 2026-09-05).** The safety factor of 14 CFR 23.303 is stated against
  every case and applied nowhere: not on a module view, not in the case index,
  not in either report, not in an exported CSV, and **not in the sbeam deck**.
  `sloads` is an external-loads program; the regulation says the factor must be
  applied, not by whom, and the sizing analysis is where it is applied
  (**OR-116/OR-117**, owner's ruling, overruling note 48's OR-87 and OR-93).
  The multiply is **removed** from 81 sites across 7 files rather than
  neutralised — a `_sf()` returning 1.0 would have left dead arithmetic reading
  as if a factor were applied, which is the opposite of what the ruling is for.
- **The deck states, per subcase, the factor it did not apply (OR-117).** One
  owner for that sentence, `export.sbeam_bridge.basis_sentence`, on the wing,
  fuselage, tail-chordwise, tail-spanwise, control-surface, stick, assembled
  balanced and LRA decks. This is the obligation that **replaces** the multiply:
  until now a recipient could read the basis off the numbers, and now the
  sentence is the only thing between them and a 1.5× error.
- **`report.LoadChannel` has one member (tier L, 2026-09-05).** Note 48 built it
  as a switch and defaulted it to ULTIMATE so the frozen `oracle_app` needed no
  edit; the default inverted underneath that file, and the `ULTIMATE` member was
  **removed** so a stale caller fails at import rather than silently receiving
  limit loads. `to_ultimate` and `render._ult` are deleted. The parameter itself
  goes at #29, when `app/views/` can be edited.
- **The `-ULT` marker now means one thing: apply nothing further.** It survives
  on the two families 14 CFR prescribes already ultimate — 23.367(a)(2) sudden
  engine stoppage and 23.561(b) emergency-landing inertia — and nowhere else
  (**OR-118**), which makes it rare enough to be conspicuous. A shared column
  header is marked only when *every* case in its table is already ultimate
  (**OR-118a**); otherwise it is plain and the `SF` column carries the basis.
- **Every artifact's in-band basis statement was rewritten to match its
  contents.** ~35 statements on shipped deliverables still claimed ULTIMATE
  after the arithmetic changed: the summary report's title-page basis line, the
  compiled PDF's per-page footer, fourteen rows of Appendix A's bundle manifest,
  the oracle report's §1 paragraph and issue-package README, the workbook's
  units line on both channels, and three validation warnings.
- **Standard docs record the inverted contract.** `CONVENTIONS.md` §3 (retitled
  *"LIMIT load contract — stated, never applied"*), `CLAUDE.md`'s Phase C
  mission sentence and load-output contract, `PROGRAM_SPEC.md`'s M4-15 block,
  `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §3.1, `ORACLE_REPORT.md` §3/§3.4,
  `00_program_overview.md`, `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`, `GUI_design.md`,
  `GUI_USER_GUIDE.md` and `theory_sources.md`.

- **The approved-corrections reference is the FAR paragraph only where one
  governs (#174, tier M, 2026-09-05).** Three register entries deviate from
  McMaster's arithmetic rather than from a regulation, and the two LANDLOAD
  entries each span several paragraphs, so those lines carry the source program
  (`CONSTANTS`, `LANDLOAD`, `WINGGEOM`) and state the FAR range inside the
  correction text. The report table's column is renamed `FAR` → `Reference`
  accordingly, and `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §4.4 states the rule (owner ruling,
  2026-09-05).

- **Module analysis is a LIMIT channel (design note 48, tier L, 2026-09-04).**
  The CLI's text and CSV output, the app's per-module tables and download
  buttons, the export bundle's `_report.txt` and per-module CSVs, and the
  sidebar's results zip now render **LIMIT** loads: the calc's own values, plain
  units with no `-ULT` marker, and the safety factor named in the `SF` column
  without being applied. ULTIMATE remains the channel of case selection, the
  sbeam export deck, the case index and the oracle technical report — none of
  which moves. `report.LoadChannel` is the parameter and it **defaults to
  ULTIMATE**, so the frozen `oracle_app` renders exactly as before without
  passing one (**OR-77**); `app/` and `cli.py` opt in explicitly.
  `methods_statement` takes the channel too, so a stamped CSV forwarded on its
  own states **its own** basis rather than the bundle's — the old block asserted
  "All loads reported here are ULTIMATE" into every CSV header, which stopped
  being true of the file it was stamped into.
- **The load-unit vocabulary has one owner (tier L, 2026-09-04).**
  `units.LOAD_UNITS` / `units.is_load_unit`, moved out of `report/render.py` now
  that the limit/ultimate boundary is no longer its only consumer
  (CLAUDE.md rule 3).

- **A paired table with nothing to put in its units column no longer prints one (tier S, 2026-08-31).**
  The oracle report's §2.3 *Limit manoeuvre load factors* table stated a blank `Units` cell on
  every row, which reads as a unit somebody forgot to enter. A limit load factor is
  dimensionless — the subsection's own text says so, and "g" would name an acceleration the
  table does not state — so the column is dropped where no row fills it. The structural design
  speeds table beside it keeps its column. The rule is in `_paired_table`, not at the one
  table, so any dimensionless pairing added later behaves the same way.

- **The oracle report's CG-case table states Xcg in %MAC, and the relation it used (tier M, 2026-08-31).**
  §2.2's *Weight and centre-of-gravity cases* table gains an `Xcg (% MAC)` column beside the
  station, and its note now prints the relation both ways —
  `%MAC = 100 (X - XLEMAC) / MAC` and `X = XLEMAC + (%MAC / 100) MAC` — with the XLEMAC and
  MAC in use and whether they came from the typed `envelope.xlemac`/`mac` override or the wing
  planform of §2.1. The column comes from `derived_geometry.mac_reference` and
  `station_to_pct_mac`, the one resolver and one relation the CG limit lines and the summary
  report's `% MAC` column already use, so a case and a limit on the same page cannot end up
  measured from two different wings. Where no reference resolves, the column prints a dash and
  the note says why, rather than showing the contract's `0.0` as if it were an answer.

- **Report dates are pickers, and an unsigned row prints no date.** The report
  page's issue date and three signature dates are date pickers storing ISO
  `YYYY-MM-DD`, so one title block cannot carry `30/8/26` and `Aug 30 2026` at
  once. The pickers open **empty** rather than at today — a date on a formal
  report is a claim about an event, and a control that defaults to the current
  date makes that claim on the author's behalf. A stored value that is not a
  date is preserved and reported rather than silently replaced, since the spec
  is a file a person is meant to be able to edit. In the document, a signature
  row with no name no longer prints its date: a date beside a ruled name blank
  reads as an approval that happened and was signed illegibly.

- **The report's introduction and limitations are yours to write.** The report
  page gains an **Introduction** block with two text areas: section 1's prose,
  and a new *Limitations and scope* subsection. Both open pre-filled — the
  introduction with the standard text, the limitations from the same methods and
  limitations statement the CSV and deck exports carry — and are the author's
  from then on, so a signed issue keeps saying what it said when it was signed.
- **The analysis basis is now Project, FAR 23 category, sloads version and
  project schema version**, with the category spelled out
  ("Normal / commuter (N)") from the existing category owner rather than left as
  a letter to look up. Design weight, wing area, VC and VD are dropped: they are
  analysis outputs a reader meets in the body. The two version rows answer
  *produced by what* — the questions that matter when a result cannot be
  reproduced years later.
- **A deselected section is no longer printed.** No heading, no reason, and the
  sections after it renumber to close the gap. The "Sections not yet produced by
  this tool" block is gone from the document.
- The limitations pre-fill carries STATUS, BASIS and KNOWN LIMITATIONS only.
  PROVENANCE, UNITS, CATEGORY, VERIFICATION, MATH and APPROVED CORRECTIONS are
  filtered out of the *report's copy* — four describe the tool rather than this
  issue's limits, and the other two are already stated in the document.

- **The report's title page carries identity and signatures only.** The analysis
  basis (project anchors and the input fingerprint) and the list of sections the
  issue does not carry have moved to the end of the introduction. Both are read
  rather than glanced at, and on the cover they pushed the signature block onto
  a second sheet — leaving the approval record on a page carrying none of the
  document's identity. The cover now fits one sheet: marking, title, document
  control, the three signature rows and the distribution statement.
- **Fixed:** the page footer printed the classification marking on top of the
  load-basis sentence. `fancyhdr` places its left, centre and right slots
  independently, so a marking of any real length overprinted its neighbour; the
  footer is now one full-width table whose columns share the line by
  construction. A placeholder's sentence is capitalised after its bold lead, and
  the introduction no longer points at the title page for a list that is not
  there any more.
- **An empty List of Figures or List of Tables now says it is empty**, and both
  appear in the Contents alongside the Abstract. A heading with nothing under it
  is a silent absence — the one thing this document does not do anywhere else —
  and a reader cannot tell "this issue has no figures" from "the list failed to
  generate". The Contents is also no longer spaced like body paragraphs, so the
  front matter fits one page instead of three.

- **The V-n figures state their construction once, not four times (tier S, 2026-08-31).**
  Each of §2.4's V-n diagrams carried the same three-sentence caption, differing only in the
  loading named in its title, so the report printed one paragraph four times and the caption
  line ran to several lines under every figure. The statement — how the boundary is drawn,
  that gust points are not vertices of it, and that the load factors are LIMIT — is now made
  once in the subsection body above the figures, and each figure's caption line carries its
  block name alone: *Figure 5: Flight envelope – CRUISE CG1 @ 0 ft*. The guard that requires
  section 2 to identify a reported load factor as LIMIT was pointed at the governing prose
  rather than relaxed, and requires the V-n captions to stay empty.

- **`Series` says whether a polyline bounds a region (tier L, 2026-09-01).**
  `report.content.Series` gains `closed`, and `planform_tex` closes a path only when it is
  set. A planform outline is a closed region; the loads reference axis drawn on the same
  figure is not, and closing it would cut a chord from tip back to root that no part of the
  airplane follows. `report.content.Units` gains `load_value`/`plain_value`, the number forms
  of the conversions its string methods already made, so a plotted load goes through the
  ULTIMATE boundary by the same route as the tabulated one beside it.

- **Full-project review filed, and the backlog given the milestones it was missing (review `2026-09-04_project_review.md` R-1…R-27, issues #172–#191, tier S, 2026-09-05).**
  A two-phase pass at `dev/v0.8.2` — implementation, maintainability and process
  controls, then analysis-method accuracy, safety-factor application and
  third-party-analyst usability. **No wrong number was found on any delivered
  load surface**, and an independent re-derivation of global equilibrium from the
  shipped balanced deck's own cards (written outside the project, using no sloads
  code) closed to 5.5e-8 Imperial / 2.2e-6 SI across all 44 subcases on both the
  `ga6_normal` oracle fixture and `concept_regional_jet`. The findings are filed
  as issues, the folds as comments on their host issues (R-8→#170, R-22→#17,
  R-25→#19), and the triage lands as Pri 26–35 of `docs/30_future/00_backlog.md`
  — an **addition, not a re-cut**: the 2026-08-29 order stands, and the
  milestone-less **band D is dissolved**, its rows keeping their Pri numbers and
  taking the milestones the triage assigned. The three first-order rows are
  deliverable-facing: the LRA decks for `ga6_normal` and `cessna_210` do not
  solve in the pinned sbeam while the roundtrip gate covers only the two
  fixtures that pass (#172), the shipped methods statement declares 3 of 7
  approved oracle deviations behind a guard that checks itself (#174), and the
  balanced deck ships `SOL 101` + `SPC = 1` over zero elements with the
  explanation living only in a test docstring (#173). Defects #170 and #171 gain
  bodies in the backlog's open-defect index and issue numbers in design note 48's
  findings list. The dissolution itself is guarded: it left **#92 and #130 in the
  table twice**, in two bands and two milestones with two bodies, which
  `test_backlog_issues.py`'s render round-trip caught at closure — the band-C
  originals are removed and the 0.9.0 copies the triage assigned are the ones
  that stand.

- **`SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §2 splits self-containment into an image rule and a data
  rule (tier M, 2026-08-30, design note 44 OR-23/OR-26).** The prohibition on
  external **image** files is unchanged and absolute — figures remain pgfplots/TikZ
  source — and the standard now states the properties it protects: deterministic,
  diffable, unit-testable as text, vector in the document's own fonts. A new *Data
  reference* clause permits a report **delivered as a package** to read plain-text
  data files from inside that package, so a table or figure is drawn from the
  delivered data rather than restating it, on four conditions: the file is listed
  in the §4.7 manifest, its path is relative and stays inside the package root, it
  is self-describing to §3.1 (units, `-ULT`, safety factor and basis), and
  determinism holds for the whole package. A report delivered as a **standalone
  `.tex`** — which the Export page's summary-report download is — SHALL NOT
  reference any external file, now held by
  `test_report_latex.py::test_the_standalone_tex_references_no_external_file`.

- **The backlog records note 49 overtaking the review's safety-factor findings
  (review 2026-09-04 follow-up, tier S, 2026-09-05).** Note 49 §8 removed every
  multiply, so two review findings changed character and two closed:
  **#170**'s defect-index entry is re-scoped from a scaled number to a wrong
  *statement* (`SF=1.5` stated against an engine rating) and widened to the
  R-8 class (max-continuous and max-accelerating torque, the two balance
  pre-closure residuals — fix by construction, not by row); row 32 (**#177**)
  likewise now claims a mis-stated factor (override ignored, `1.5` where the
  stamped path says `N/A`), not a mis-applied one. The promised
  **"Review 2026-09-04 small items" index** is added (#175/#176/#178/#179/
  #180/#188), with #178's mislabel noted as mattering *more* post-note-49,
  since the statement is now all there is. **#181 and #182 are recorded as
  overtaken and are closed on GitHub** — the Subpart-D sentence ships in every
  basis statement, and OR-119 ruled the G-OR-49/OR-93 contradiction *decided,
  not fixed*. Row 24's deliverable line drops "ULT-marked" for "LIMIT with the
  factor stated per case (note 49 OR-116)".

- **No critical-case down-select survives into the ground loads (design note 44 OR-184, tier L, 2026-09-07).**
  Section 12 and Appendix F carry every one of the 33 LANDLOAD conditions, and
  say so. A ground case sizes a gear member through a load path the loads
  analysis does not model — a drag brace, a side brace, a trunnion — so the case
  that governs one member is not the case that governs another, and ranking 33
  conditions on a single scalar answers a question nobody asked while removing
  the case a reader needs. The per-family largest reactions are still printed and
  are labelled a reading aid.
- **The entered landing load factor is stated beside the computed one (OR-187).**
  `ga6_normal` enters `N = 3.167` against LGFACTOR's energy estimate of 3.0970;
  `concept_regional_jet` enters 2.67 — exactly the 23.473(g) floor — against
  2.3755. The reactions run at the entered value, which is the user's decision to
  make; §12.2 prints both pairs and names which governed, because a section that
  presented an entered number as the output of the drop-test calculation would
  describe an analysis nobody ran.
- **`modules/landing.py` under the OR-15 admission of 2026-09-07 (OR-190).**
  `_geometry` becomes `landing_geometry` and `_critical` becomes
  `critical_reaction` with a gear argument. No arithmetic in either is touched.

- **The applied wing load set states all six body-axis components (design note 46, tier L, 2026-09-03).**
  Appendix B.1 of the oracle technical report and the `wing_applied_loads.csv`
  download beside it published `Fz`, `Fx` and `Myy free`. A consumer writing
  `FORCE`/`MOMENT` cards needs the whole vector, and from three columns cannot
  tell whether a missing one is zero or merely unpublished. Both views now
  carry `Fx`, `Fy`, `Fz`, `Mx`, `My`, `Mz`, with the three structural zeros
  **printed** and their reason stated: the wing chain has no producer for a
  spanwise strip load and no delivered wing condition is lateral (`Fy`), and a
  strip applies forces and a section moment and nothing else, so all of the
  cumulative `Mxx`/`Mzz` is those forces acting through arms the coordinates
  already state (`Mx`, `Mz`). The map from the calc's positive-magnitude beam
  convention to right-handed body axes has one owner, `applied_body_moments`
  over `coordinates.bending_moment_vector`, so neither view carries sign logic.
  Both wing CSVs now state in-band which moment convention each column block
  uses — the span-load file carries applied card components and cumulative beam
  integrals side by side, and its `Mz` and `Mzz` have opposite senses.

### Fixed

- **A stale AGREED header on a shipped design note now fails CI (issue #183,
  tier S, 2026-09-08).** Three of the last four tier-L closures left their
  note's Status at plain AGREED (46/47/48, review R-13), and the #128 guard
  never fired because it matches only explicit "unbuilt" phrasing — while
  `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §4 step 3 rolls notes to `docs/40_history/` **by status
  header**, so an unflipped note is skipped by the roll and a wrong status
  enters the permanent record. The flip half shipped with #190 (which found
  note 50 equally stale); this change adds the guard and, sweeping with it,
  found and flipped a fifth the issue did not know about: **note 53**, whose
  work shipped 2026-09-07 as step 163 in step 162's commit `175369e`. The
  guard (`test_doc_currency.py`) uses the same in-repo proxy as #128, narrowed
  to where it is unambiguous: a `changes/*.history.md` fragment whose own
  `## Step` heading names "(design) note N" is that note's closure record, and
  note N's Status paragraph must then carry SHIPPED/BUILT/✅. A prose mention
  in a fragment body ("until note 51 lands") deliberately does not count —
  note 51 is exactly that case today and stays AGREED. Proven both ways:
  reverting note 53's header fails the guard on that note alone.

- **A live design note's INDEX row is a pointer again, not a second copy of
  the note (issue #187, tier S, 2026-09-08).** Note 44's `docs/00_INDEX.md`
  row had grown to ~600 words restating OR-13…OR-37 with its own copy of the
  status, and other rows mirrored the stale AGREED that #183 fixed in the
  notes — a second hand-maintained statement per note, the rule-3 drift
  class, already drifting. All ten `30_future/` rows are rewritten to one
  sentence plus the pointer with **no status**: the note's own Status line is
  the single owner. Guarded (`test_doc_currency.py`): a `30_future/` row over
  320 characters or carrying AGREED/SHIPPED/BUILT/PROPOSED fails CI.
  `40_history/` rows are exempt by decision — an archived note's status can
  never change again, so those rows are frozen record and the long
  descriptions there are the index's value as a finding aid for closed work.
  Proven both ways: adding "AGREED 2026-08-29" back to note 44's row fails
  the guard.

- **A V-n point selected by more than one condition kept only the last case id (design note 44 OR-200, tier L, 2026-09-07).**
  `select._stamp_case_refs` assigned `p.case_ref` per condition, so a point that
  is the source of several lost all but one: on `ga6_normal` V-n case 14 is
  `VT-01`, `VT-02` **and** `VT-03`, case 74 is `HT-03` and `HT-09`, case 30 is
  `W-03` and `F-01` — 4, 5 and 4 multiply-selected points on the three shipped
  examples. Nothing shipped was wrong, because the field had one writer and no
  reader outside serialisation; it is fixed at its first reader rather than
  ranked against the fidelity backlog. The stamp now appends, and clears first,
  so stamping one envelope twice is the same as stamping it once.
- **The register of decisions was missing a decision that shipped code cites.**
  `report/render.py`, the step-165 history fragment and backlog row 38 all cite
  "note 44 OR-193", but design note 44 defined only OR-183 … OR-192. OR-193 is
  now in the register, and **G-OR-137** sweeps every `OR-n`/`G-OR-n` cited
  anywhere under `sloads/`, `tests/`, `docs/` or `changes/` and requires each to
  be defined in a design note — the gate that would have caught it.
- **OR-193's own gate was a frozen digest, not a stated property.** Its docstring
  claimed the fix was gated; the only thing holding it was the Imperial baseline,
  which fails as a *changed number*, so a change that moved the engine locations
  and regenerated the baseline would have passed. **G-OR-138** asserts the
  property instead: every condition an engine emits sits at one point, and no two
  engines share it — verified to fail against the defect it names.

- **Appendix B claimed the selected set, stated no factor, and dangled its footnote (#229, 2026-09-08 review R4/R5, tier S, 2026-09-08).**
  The intro claimed *"every selected case"* while the tables carry the entered
  set that replaced the selection (C210-30) — W-02/03/04 are selection-named
  in the registers and have no station tables — it now says "every case run"
  and repeats §3.2's not-enveloping warning through the same owner
  (`_negative_case_sentence`), so the reader of the appendix does not need
  §3.2 to learn the document holds no down-bending wing case. B.2, the one
  load table without an `SF` column, carries one now, read back against the
  owner case by case like its fuselage twin, and its footnote's dangling
  fragment ("…Its safety factor.") is repaired. The rule-4 sweep found the
  same claim-without-statement in the ground unbalanced-moment table's note,
  fixed the same way, and a new G-OR-20/G-OR-4 extension gate sweeps every
  `(LIMIT)`-titled table in both shipped documents: the 23.303 factor is
  stated in an `SF` column or, where it is one value, in the note with its
  applied-to-nothing clause.

- **Appendices D and E did not carry every applied load the deck emits, and said they
  did (note 44 §18 OR-143, tier L, 2026-09-07).** Both stated that "a row here and the
  card that carries it are the same load". Per station the spanwise deck writes a
  `MOMENT` card from the strip torsion and folds the span-axis axial into the `FORCE`
  card; the appendix printed one force column and no moment at all. First case, summed
  over stations: horizontal-tail applied torsion **6,689 lb-in** on `ga6_normal` and
  **232,139** on `concept_regional_jet`; fin torsion **2,351** and **80,117**, with
  **23.1 lb** and **638.5 lb** of axial. Appendix E's note further stated that the two
  components beside its normal load were "not zero by measurement but absent by
  construction" — for the fin `Fz` is neither, and never was. Three shipped examples
  also carry a T-tail transfer node that neither appendix printed. A reader building a
  model from D or E got an under-loaded surface and was told the set was complete.
  **G-OR-90** now holds every appendix row to the card the deck writes at that grid,
  case by case, on all three shipped examples.

- **The fin's torsion was stated about an axis a lateral load cannot twist (note 44 §18
  OR-142/OR-146, tier L, 2026-09-07).** `applied_body_moments` returned
  `(mx, myy_free, mz)` for every row — right for the wing and the horizontal tail, whose
  span is `y`, and wrong for the fin, whose span is `z`: its torsion is `Mz`, and
  negated. Section 6.5 printed the same quantity as **`Myy` = 4,561 lb-in** at
  `ga6_normal`'s fin root, when the airplane's `My` on a fin is *identically zero*: a
  lateral force produces no moment about the `y` axis at all. Section 3.2 maps the beam
  symbols onto body axes two chapters earlier, so a reader carried that map into
  section 6 where it was wrong by ninety degrees. `coordinates.tail_torsion_to_airplane`
  had owned the right map, with the sign derived rather than asserted, since the deck was
  written; the report was the consumer that did not call it. Section 6.5 and Appendix E
  now print `Mzz`/`Mz`, and each notation table names the airplane axis rather than
  leaving the letter to carry it.

- **Appendix B.1 stated its safety factor somewhere else (note 44 §18 OR-139, tier L,
  2026-09-07).** Alone among the four applied appendices, and in the one a reader is
  likeliest to lift rows from. It also carried no `GID`, so a wing row was the only one
  that could not be tied to the card that carries it.

- **The single-owner constant guard read a glyph width as the dynamic-pressure divisor
  (tier S, 2026-09-07).** `\b295\b` treats a decimal point as a word boundary, so it
  matched the `295` inside `6.295`. Every literal in that guard now has to *start* a
  number rather than be a run of digits taken out of the middle of one.

- **The oracle report defines every symbol it prints (design note 47, tier L, 2026-09-03).**
  Section 3.3 shipped the column heading `Root chord bending Mzz` against a 3.2
  notation table that defined no `Mzz` — a break of the report's own rule that a
  column heading anywhere in section 3 names a symbol from that table and
  nothing else. The guard covered the two appendix tables only, so the rule was
  unguarded exactly where it was broken. `LoadValue` gains `symbol`, the notation
  symbol held as data on the value rather than as a substring of its display
  label (OR-74, the third instance of the move `frame` and `point` already
  made), and the guard reads it. Parsing was never an option: `Root torsion Myy
  (25% chord)` does not end in its symbol, and two different labels carry the
  same one. The guard now walks section 3's own tables as well as the appendix's
  (OR-75) and additionally asserts that each label prints the symbol it declares,
  so heading and notation cannot drift apart in either direction. Second **OR-15
  admission** of 2026-09-03: `sloads/modules/net_loads.py` is frozen, and the
  manifest is updated in the same commit per G-OR-9. `LoadValue` is persisted
  inside `critical.conditions[].loads`, so the addition is an on-disk shape
  change and `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumps to 60 with an identity hop — the third of
  exactly this shape, after v58's `frame` and v59's `point`.

- **A deck value on a rounding tie printed two different loads (tier M,
  2026-09-06).** `dev/v0.8.2` had been red on the Linux CI leg for four
  consecutive commits — the frozen Imperial digest failing on
  `concept_regional_jet`'s `sbeam/balanced_deck` while the same commit passed on
  the developer's Mac. `_fmt` states **seven** significant digits, which is finer
  than a computed load reproduces across platforms, so a value sitting on the
  decimal rounding tie of its seventh digit took round-half-even off the last
  bit: `-341426.25` in the regional jet's `MOMENT` cards printed
  `-3.414262E+05` here and `-3.414263E+05` there, for one load. Every emitted
  value is now canonicalised to twelve significant figures first —
  **248 of the 159,407 values the six baseline decks emit were tie-fragile under
  ±3 ulp; none are now**, and 36 emitted lines moved, every one a single digit in
  the seventh place where no information was carried.
- **The same load printed as two different numbers on one row of a shipped gear
  report.** `atr42_100`'s `LG-19…LG-22` stated *Ground-line V* as
  `2.448331E+04` and *Datum Fz* — the same load — as `2.448330E+04`, because the
  two columns straddled the tie from opposite sides. They now agree. This was
  live in a delivered artifact, not only in CI.
- **The twelve-figure rule has one owner instead of two copies.** The human
  channel got this fix at #147 (`report/render.py`); the solver channel never
  did, and the class recurred one channel over. `units.canonical` is now the
  single owner both read (`CONVENTIONS.md` §7, clauses (d) and (e)), guarded by
  `test_platform_stability.py::test_no_emitted_deck_value_hangs_on_the_last_ulp`
  over every value every deck actually emits on all six examples.

- **The 23.367 cases reached the load-case index carrying no load at all (note 44
  OR-180, tier L, 2026-09-07).** The module published its headline load under the
  key `max_tail_load`; `render.load_cases_to_rows` maps `fy_side`. Every 23.367
  row in the published case file therefore had an ID, a regulation, a speed and a
  factor, and no load. The fin load is a side load and is keyed as one.
- **An SI deliverable could head a column in `ft-lb` or `in`.**
  `render._detect_moment_unit` fell back to the Imperial `ft-lb`, and the
  location fallback to `in`, whatever system the set was rendered in. Nothing
  exercised it while every result set with a case index also carried a moment and
  a location; the one-engine-out set carries neither. Both fallbacks now read the
  set's own force unit for their system.
- **Deck subcase comments overran the 72-column card width.**
  `subcase_map_block` and three per-case `$` headers built their own lines
  instead of going through `sbeam_bridge._comment`, so they carried their own
  width assumption — fine while every condition name was as short as `PHAA`, and
  an overrun on the four turboprop tail decks the moment one was not. The width
  is the emitter's property now, which is the rule the wing decks were already
  moved to.
- **A negative zero in the tail deck's inertia statement.** The fin's lateral
  factor is exactly zero on a condition naming no V-n point, so the inertia total
  printed `-0.0 lb` — which reads as a small negative load rather than as none.

- **`ga6_normal`'s engine and propeller CG waterlines are corrected against
  Appendix A p227 (note 44 §20 OR-170, tier L, 2026-09-07).** The fixture entered
  `engine_cg = (22, 0, −10)` and `prop_cg = (−10, 0, 93.022)`, putting the worked
  example's engine at waterline −10 and its combined CG at **3.166** where the
  page prints **93.022**. Reading the page's input block back gives
  `ENGINE CG 22, 0, 92` and `PROPELLER CG −10, 0, 100`, which reproduce the
  printed combined CG exactly — the propeller's `x` had been pasted into the
  engine's `z`, and the printed *combined* `z` into the propeller's. The fixture
  comment recorded that only `x` was ever checked, and no test asserted `zpp`;
  one does now. The deck's `lra-engine-mount` and `lra-engine-hub` nodes move
  with it, so the Imperial baseline digests are regenerated.

- **A FAR 25 gyroscopic condition no longer loses its four sign combinations.**
  `report.render.load_cases_to_rows` fanned out a gyroscopic condition by
  matching its FAR **reference** against `23.371(b)`, so `25.371` — which packs
  the same four sub-cases under a different reference — printed a single row with
  no moments in it at all, on the Engine Mount page's load-case file. The
  question "does this condition fan out?" is now asked of the **keys** the
  sub-cases are carried in, which is what identifies them.

- **A report section that discovers its own absence renders it.** A builder that
  returned a stated absence — because a module declined to produce a result from
  slices the plan had found populated — had that sentence dropped, leaving a
  numbered heading with nothing under it. It now renders through the ABSENT
  state's own lead, so a builder cannot word absence a second way. The hole was
  under every builder that returns one, sections 7, 8 and 9 included.

- **A counter-clockwise engine's sudden-stoppage torque is no longer a
  pound-foot short.** `ENGLOADS.BAS` prints `INT(-TORQSUDSTOP)` and BASIC's
  `INT` **floors** rather than truncating toward zero, so applying the rotation
  direction inside the flooring made `floor(-6824.6) = -6825` for one sense and
  `floor(+6824.6) = +6824` for the other — a difference in the rounding
  presented as a difference in the load. The oracle's own floored value is the
  clockwise one, and the opposite sense now publishes its exact negative. Caught
  by **G-53.1** on its first run; the printed Appendix B figure is untouched.

- **Entered leading- and trailing-edge polylines are the geometry source of record
  (tier L, 2026-08-30).** Where a surface carries LE/TE polylines, its area, aspect ratio,
  MAC and 25 %-MAC station are computed from them. `sloads/modules/wing_geometry.py`
  integrates the closed planform in **closed form** rather than by WINGGEOM's unprinted
  strip count: both edges are piecewise linear, so every integral has an exact value on
  each interval between their breakpoints. `elements` reverts to meaning only the spanwise
  load-station count. A surface whose edges span different stations is closed by its root
  and tip chords — the root chord running from the lowest-span leading-edge point to the
  lowest-span trailing-edge point, the tip chord likewise at maximum span — and its span is
  measured across both edges. `tail_geometry` and `TailPlanform` now ask
  `wing_geometry.planform_boundary` instead of carrying two more copies of the integration;
  the copies had already drifted apart. Registered oracle deviation:
  `docs/20_theory/02_approved_corrections.md`, "WINGGEOM's strip sum goes closed-form".

- **Two cross-references pointed at plan keys that cannot exist (#230, 2026-09-08 review R6, tier S, 2026-09-08).**
  `NOT_CARRIED` was written for genuinely deselected or unbuilt targets, but
  §2.4 passed `"flight_envelope_cases"` — a key the plan has never had — and
  §4.3 with Table 25's footnote passed `"tail_loads"`, retired as a section
  key by the OR-129 htail/vtail partition, so every issue of every report
  told the reader its design-case tabulation and its pull-up derivation were
  *"in a section this issue does not carry"* while carrying both. §2.4 now
  points at Appendix A (the candidate register) and the component case
  registers; §4.3 points at the horizontal-tail section through the existing
  `_tail_section_key` composer. Two guards make it structural: a static
  sweep resolves every key passed to `section_ref`/`subsection_ref` —
  literals, module constants, the declared composer — and fails on a key
  the full plan does not carry *or* an argument it cannot resolve, and a
  runtime gate asserts a full build of both shipped examples never prints
  `NOT_CARRIED` anywhere. G-OR-68's own test was complicit — it looked up
  `"tail_loads"` too, degraded in lockstep and asserted the broken sentence —
  and now demands a resolved section number on both references.

- **The folder-dialog test no longer asserts the host's own dialog helpers (tier S, 2026-08-31).**
  `test_the_folder_dialog_never_raises_and_never_invents_a_path` stubbed the
  subprocess but not the command resolution, so it read whichever helper the
  machine running it happened to have. `choose_directory` returns `None` before it
  runs anything when the platform has none, and the CI runner has neither `zenity`
  nor `kdialog` — so the first case failed there while passing on every developer
  Mac. The four non-answers it covers are decisions made *after* the helper runs,
  so the helper has to exist for them to be reachable; the platform is now pinned
  alongside the subprocess. `sloads/export/directory_dialog.py` is unchanged: its
  behaviour on a machine with no dialog was correct, and is what the sibling test
  pins from the other side.

- **The fuselage LRA waterline is read (tier L, 2026-09-07).**
  `FuselageMassInput.ref_waterline` has been documented since it was added as the
  waterline the body's mass distribution is carried along, and nothing read it:
  the component deck put the body beam at `z = 0` ("the component in isolation")
  and the airplane LRA model ran it on the fuselage section-centre line. On
  `ga6_normal` that is 23.5 in from where the project file says the beam is, and
  the field registry recorded the state as *"reserved … any value, 0 included, is
  currently equivalent"*. `derived_geometry.fuselage_lra` is now the single owner
  — entered waterline, else the section-centre line, else a loud zero — and
  `export/lra_model` asks it. The third instance of one defect class this
  milestone: an entered value with the right intent, shadowed by a derived
  stand-in, with nothing saying so.

- **Four of six fixtures placed their body beam outside their own fuselage
  (tier L, 2026-09-07).** Found by wiring the waterline up: `atr42_100` 35 in
  below its floor, `dhc8_dash8` 47 in, `cessna_210` 10, `ga6_normal` 5 — and
  three unrelated airplanes all entering the same round `100.0`, which is what a
  placeholder looks like. Using them as entered made the ATR-42's LRA deck
  singular. Every value is corrected to its own body's centre line, and
  `fuselage_lra` states a waterline that lies outside the body it belongs to
  rather than trusting it, so the class cannot recur silently. The corrected
  values reproduce the previous node positions to the rounding of an entered
  number (0.03 in), so no deck geometry moves and no load changes.

- **Section 12's attitude labels were swapped between families, and its case-range claim overlapped (#227, 2026-09-08 review R1/R2, tier S, 2026-09-08).**
  The Ground load conditions table labelled the tail-down landings (cases
  13–24) "Ground roll and handling" and the ground-roll cases 7–9 "Tail-down
  landing": `_ground_cases` indexed `_GROUND_ATTITUDES` by tuple *position*
  with `attitude_of`'s ground-angle index, and that tuple is deliberately not
  in gra order — its gra-index lives in its own third element, which the
  (correct) figures read. The loads themselves were verified right; only the
  label picked the wrong geometry for the reader. The title is now matched on
  the gra-index element. The strut-state table's second defect: it printed
  each geometry's cases as `min-max`, so the level attitude's 1–6 and 10–12
  became "1-12", claiming 7–9 at two ground angles at once — it now prints
  the exact runs through `_case_range_words`. Two G-OR-128 extension gates
  read both printed columns back against `attitude_of` and the free body,
  case by case, on every shipped example (rule 3: the owner existed, the
  consumer bypassed it).

- **The GUI journey test no longer drives disabled widgets (tier S, 2026-09-02).**
  `tests/test_gui_journey.py::_touch_everything` set a value on every widget on every page,
  disabled ones included. A Streamlit release refused the interaction outright — *"Cannot
  update a disabled radio widget ... A browser user cannot interact with a disabled
  widget"* — turning the whole journey suite red on CI while the pinned local environment
  still permitted it. Disabled widgets are now skipped, for both the value-bearing widgets
  and the form submit buttons. That is what the function's own docstring has always claimed
  ("every **editable** block"): a page disables a control to say this cannot be entered here
  and now, and a journey that drove it anyway asserted about a gesture no browser user can
  make. No assertion was weakened — every `KNOWN_OPEN` entry still reproduces, which is the
  guard that says so.

- **The GUI no longer claims ULTIMATE on LIMIT deliverables, and G-OR-74 now
  reaches the screen (#192, tier M, 2026-09-05).** Note 49's OR-116 made every
  delivered load LIMIT, but its AST sweep was a one-off discovery pass, so the
  gate that replaced it read only rendered documents. **21 live false claims
  survived in 15 `app/` files** — including a *"Download net wing loads —
  ULTIMATE (CSV)"* button whose bytes are byte-identical to the module's LIMIT
  values, so an analyst who trusted the label under-sized by 1.5, and captions
  on Wing, Fuselage, Tail, Landing, Flight Envelope and Results Review stating
  *"= limit × 1.5 (14 CFR 23.303)"* of numbers nothing multiplies. All are now
  LIMIT statements naming the factor they do not apply.
- **The Wing and Fuselage download buttons name their channel, not their basis.**
  Both files on each page have been LIMIT since OR-116, so a basis marker no
  longer distinguishes them: they are now *analysis table* and *sbeam bridge*.
  The `*_ULT.csv` file names are unchanged and stay stale until OR-81 (0.8.3).
- **G-OR-74's checker could be defeated by typography.** `_CLAIMS` was a
  substring list, so markdown emphasis split `**ULTIMATE** = limit` and the
  U+00D7 `×` in `limit × SF` never matched its ASCII spelling; text is now
  normalised before the scan. The claim boundary also excludes a trailing
  hyphen, so Structural Speeds' true *"ULTIMATE-independent design limit
  speeds"* is no longer a false hit.
- **A green test was pinning the false claim.**
  `test_deliverable_units.py::test_the_export_page_states_the_system_it_will_write`
  asserted the Export page caption *contains* "ULTIMATE"; it now requires LIMIT.

- **Section 10 promised gyroscopic cases no reciprocating installation runs (#228, 2026-09-08 review R3, tier S, 2026-09-08).**
  §10.1's prose — "14 CFR 23.371(b) is assessed for every sign combination of
  its two moments, all four of which are printed below" — and the case-list
  note describing the a/b/c/d suffixes were fixed strings, unconditioned on
  engine type, so both shipped reports (GA-6 and Baron, reciprocating)
  contradicted their own printed case set, which correctly carries no
  23.371(b) case. The gyroscopic prose (exemption, thrust-appears-only-there,
  side-load clause, table note) is now conditioned on a gyroscopic case being
  in the printed set — read off the tables themselves, not the engine type —
  and the no-gyro build states its own not-applicable in the §11 discipline:
  the reason stated, nothing promised. A G-OR-107 extension gate asserts the
  a/b/c/d prose appears iff a suffixed case is printed, across examples
  covering both directions.

- **The oracle technical report printed 1.5× Appendix A's figures, and nothing
  caught it (design note 49 E-c, tier L, 2026-09-05).** Appendix A is a **limit**
  oracle and the oracle tests compare at calc level — they never cross the render
  boundary — so §3's tables rendered ultimate against a document whose whole
  purpose is to be read against p131, and the entire oracle suite stayed green.
  `oracle_sections._load_cell` no longer scales.
- **Seven deck comments asserted the loads were ultimate over LIMIT cards
  (2026-09-05).** Five said *"Loads are ULTIMATE (limit x SF=1.5)"* — the wing
  card block, fuselage, chordwise tail, spanwise tail and control surface — and
  two of those printed a derivation, `= 1.5 x (LT25 + LT50)` and
  `(= 1.5 x critical load …)`, for sums that no longer contained the 1.5. Two
  more said it in different words: the balanced deck's *"the cards below are
  ULTIMATE"*, ten times per deck, and the wing stick deck's
  *"(closed-form, ULTIMATE)"*. Found by **G-OR-73** on its first run.
- **Appendix A's bundle manifest called the per-module CSVs ULTIMATE, and had
  since design note 48 (2026-09-05).** Those CSVs moved to LIMIT then and the
  manifest was never re-read, so the controlling document's statement of what
  each bundle file *is* contradicted the file for a whole release.
  `test_every_manifest_row_states_the_basis_its_file_actually_carries` could not
  see it: it pins the manifest's prose against a hand-written map in the test
  file, so it detects drift between the two and not falsehood in the pair. Both
  were wrong and it stayed green. **G-OR-74** is the truth side; the pin keeps
  its own job, and `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §4.7 now requires both.
- **`tests/test_report_latex.py` had a gate that passed on prose (2026-09-05).**
  `test_ultimate_markers_and_sf_columns_are_present` asserted `"lbs-ULT" in tex`
  and passed after the sweep — satisfied by the methods stamp *explaining* the
  marker (*"…carry a '-ULT' marker (lbs-ULT, …)"*) rather than by any data cell.
  Replaced by a check on table content with the explanatory prose excluded.
- **`tests/test_data_dictionary.py`'s self-runner was broken (2026-09-05).** Its
  `__main__` block called `test_gui_design_schema_line_current`, a name that no
  longer exists, so the zero-dependency self-runner CLAUDE.md requires of every
  test file died with `NameError`. Found by the new citation guard, which caught
  `GUI_design.md` naming the same dead test.
- **Five test citations in the standard docs named tests that no longer exist
  (2026-09-05).** Two in `ORACLE_REPORT.md`'s conformance table and two in
  `SUMMARY_REPORT.md`'s checklist (renamed by this milestone), one in
  `GUI_design.md` (predating it), and one in `02_approved_corrections.md`'s
  superseded ground-roll entry — reworded to past tense rather than renamed, so
  the historical record stands and the reference still resolves. A conformance
  row naming a deleted test claims a gate that is not there.

- **The methods statement declares every approved correction, and its guard reads
  the register (#174, review R-3, tier M, 2026-09-05).** `report.methods`
  declared 3 of the register's 7 approved deviations, so four reached no analyst:
  the truncated-constants sweep (2026-08-17), both LANDLOAD sign corrections
  (#133/#134, 2026-08-29) and WINGGEOM's closed-form integration (2026-08-30) —
  the last three move printed-page figures an analyst compares against the
  manual. All four are now stamped in band on every channel: CSV headers, sbeam
  deck comments, `METHODS.txt`, the workbook's *Methods* sheet and report §5.
  `test_statement_lists_every_approved_correction` no longer checks the rendered
  statement against the tuple it was rendered from — a circular guard CI could
  not fail — but parses
  [`docs/20_theory/02_approved_corrections.md`](docs/20_theory/02_approved_corrections.md)
  and asserts set, order and text against its `## Register` section, with a
  companion asserting no *withdrawn* or *declined* heading is ever declared.

- **A condition that is not a load case no longer claims a safety factor
  (#154, design note 48, tier L, 2026-09-04).** Surface geometry, weights,
  centres of gravity, design speeds, Mach-limit lines and a dimensionless
  landing load factor carried `safety_factor = 1.5` from the dataclass default
  and printed it, so a table of areas and chord lengths was headed
  `[ULTIMATE, SF=1.5]`. `ConditionResult.safety_factor` is now `Optional[float]`
  and renders `N/A`; `safety_factors.prescribes_factor` is its single owner — a
  condition prescribes no factor exactly when it states no value in load units
  **and** carries no `case_ref`. Measured, that is 38 conditions on both shipped
  airframes. The `case_ref` clause is load-bearing: SELECT's six critical wing
  conditions publish no load value (their loads live on `WingLoadResult`) but
  are load cases whose bulk-data cards are factored, and blanking them would
  have printed `N/A` in the case index against a factored case. The governing
  table writes the `None` through `stamp()`, since `registry.run_all_modules`
  re-stamps every condition and a dataclass default alone would not have
  survived the shipped path. Nothing substitutes 1.0 silently: `_ult`, `_scale`,
  `GoverningTable.required_factor_for` and the report's `_required_sf` all raise
  on a load found inside a factorless condition.

- **Both failed engines printed at the same butt line, and "Engine 1" meant a different engine per page (#231, 2026-09-08 review R7, tier S, 2026-09-08).**
  §11's input table printed `bleng` — the march's magnitude — so the Baron's
  two rows both said +1676 mm while the section's own footnote explains that
  which side failed sets the fin-load sign; the signed butt line is now
  recovered through the module's own side owner (`-sense × bleng`) and the
  note states the convention. The identity flip — §10 "Engine 1/Engine 2",
  §11 "engine 0/engine 1" — is settled 1-based with one owner per layer:
  `_engine_label` in `one_engine_out.py` now mints " (engine 1)" into the
  case names, and the published condition note's "Failed engine #0 at butt
  line 66 in" — 0-based and unsigned in one breath — states the 1-based
  number and the signed butt line (OR-15 admission granted 2026-09-08,
  scoped to those two sites),
  and §11's tables, figure titles and exclusion prose print through a single
  `_oei_engine_number` owner. Guards: the input table's butt lines equal the
  side owner's signed values on the Baron, §10 and §11 name the same engine
  by the same number with the same designation, the case names carry
  "(engine 1)/(engine 2)", and "engine 0" appears nowhere in the rendered
  document. The OR-13 manifest records the admission against the new hash,
  and the Imperial baseline is regenerated for the label-only drift in the
  twins' case names.

- **Three owners described 23.367(a)(2) with three nouns, two of them torque (#233 closing #178, 2026-09-08 review R9, tier S, 2026-09-08).**
  The report Introduction said "engine torque", the methods statement "engine
  torque and engine-failure fin loads", and the governing safety-factor
  table's own basis "the sudden-stoppage torque case" (#178) — but the
  family's members are the OEI fin cases, and every torque condition (23.361
  mount torque, 23.361(b)(1) sudden stoppage) is LIMIT ×1.5, so each torque
  noun invited exactly the backwards reading §10 warns against: treating
  mount torque as already ultimate. The regulation's own subjects
  (14 CFR 23.367, "Unsymmetrical loads due to engine failure"; (a)(2) makes
  ultimate "the loads resulting from the disconnection of the engine
  compressor from the turbine or from loss of the turbine blades",
  CFR-2011-title14-vol1) are now one noun —
  `safety_factors.ENGINE_FAILURE_NOUN`, "engine-failure unsymmetrical loads"
  — stated in the rewritten row basis and consumed verbatim by the
  Introduction and the methods statement; the theory register's family table
  row is renamed to match. Guard: the basis must quote the CFR's subjects and
  the family's self-description, the Introduction and the methods statement
  must carry the owner's noun and may attach no torque noun to 23.367 in any
  clause.

- **Section 2.1's wing table printed a different MAC/XLEMAC pair than every
  %MAC in the document, under 2.2's claim that they were one (#234, 2026-09-08
  review R10, tier S, 2026-09-08).**
  Table 1 was the configuration module's *parametric cross-check* — WINGGEOM's
  integration of a two-point trapezoid regenerated from the layout scalars —
  while the spanwise distributions and the %MAC reference integrate the stored
  surface polylines; on the GA-6's cranked wing the two are 6.9 in of XLEMAC
  apart (56.73 vs 63.62), and 2.2's note attributed its pair to "the wing
  planform stated in 2.1", so a reader converting %MAC with Table 1's numbers
  landed on different stations than the document's with no warning. 2.1 now
  prints the stored planform's own integration through a new owner accessor,
  `derived_geometry.planform_geometry_condition` (resolving the same surface
  `mac_reference` reads, honouring gate DG-3's producer/owner shape), with a
  note naming the polylines it integrated; the parametric condition remains
  only as the fallback when no
  stored wing integrates — the case where 2.2 has no planform pair to
  attribute either. The typed wing area S and the `envelope.xlemac`/`mac`
  pair stay legitimate overrides and are named as such where printed; the
  integrated areas leave the table so STRSPEED's governing S is stated once.
  Register rule added (ORACLE_REPORT.md §2.1). Guard: 2.1's MAC and XLE(MAC)
  rows must equal the %MAC reference's formatted pair — proven distinct from
  the trapezoid's — and 2.2's note must print that pair and its provenance.

- **Two entered fields the oracle document depends on were reset before it read them
  (note 44 OR-134a, tier L, 2026-09-07).** The document is a function of
  `reduce_to_oracle_inputs` (OR-43), so a field outside the oracle input set is
  silently replaced by its dataclass default between the project and the page — not
  absent, *different*. `geometry.parametric.tail_type` was reset to `CONVENTIONAL`, so
  every airplane read as a conventional tail and the withholding above fired on nothing;
  `geometry.surfaces[].ref_axis_pct` was reset to the 25 % default, so the document
  stated its torsion about the quarter chord while every other consumer used the entered
  40 % — `ga6_normal`'s horizontal-tail root torsion **60.8 → 34.5 lb-in**,
  `concept_regional_jet`'s **4141.7 → 3645.3**, and every Appendix D/E applied-load `X`
  **3–6 in** off the deck card the appendix states it is the same load as. All seven
  shipped examples enter the axis. Both fields are now `supplied` and render in the
  registry-driven oracle form; no frozen file was touched.

- **The wing torsion is stated about the axis OR-51 ruled it is stated about (tier L,
  2026-09-07).** Section 3's gate asserted `25% chord` and its docstring explained the
  reset above as a decision — *"the report cannot print a 40 % chord torsion"* — where
  OR-51 had ruled the opposite in as many words: *"`ga6_normal` enters `ref_axis: 0.4`,
  so its wing torsion is delivered about the LRA 40 % chord … the report must not print
  one and call it the other."* The gate now reads the axis from the project rather than
  pinning a literal.

- **Section 6 no longer borrows section 5's flaps-extended absence (note 44 OR-131,
  tier L, 2026-09-07).** The flaps-extended gust of 23.425(a)(2) is a *horizontal* tail
  requirement with no counterpart in 23.441 or 23.443; stating it under the vertical
  tail described an absence that is not that surface's. Caught by the OR-131 gate on the
  first build of the mirror.

- **The vertical tail's loads reference axis was drawn along its root, not up its
  span (owner, 2026-09-07).** `WingStationLoad` documented its coordinates as airplane
  axes, and for the wing and the horizontal tail they are. On the **fin** they are not:
  `y` is the span coordinate in the surface's own plane and `z` is the root waterline
  that span is measured from. Section 6.1 read the names at face value, so Figure 24
  drew the axis as a flat row of markers along the constant 111.5 root waterline
  instead of climbing 112.9 → 167.1 up the fin, and its station table labelled the
  height above the root a *butt line*. Both now resolve the point through
  `export.coordinates.tail_station_to_airplane` — the owner the exported deck and
  Appendices D and E already used, which is why those were right — so the figure, the
  table and the FORCE card place a station at one point by construction. The analysis,
  the decks and the CSVs were never affected.

- **The tail and wing loads-reference-axis figures legended their stations "Design CG
  cases" (tier M, 2026-09-07).** `PlotData.points_label` was left at the V-n figure's
  default, so three figures named a different figure entirely — the defect that field
  was added to prevent. They say "Load stations".

- **Table columns could print on top of one another (tier M, 2026-09-07).** The width
  solver documents a floor — a column is never narrower than its longest unbreakable
  token, because a `p` column wraps between words and never inside one — and its last
  fallback scaled every column past it. On `ga6_normal` the `14 CFR` column of Table 25
  needed 63pt for `23.423(a)(1)` and was given 26, so the regulation printed over the CG
  case as `23.423(a)(1)G4` and a reader could not tell which CG case the condition was
  run at. The floor is absolute now; a table that cannot be set upright at either size
  is turned onto a landscape page instead (owner, 2026-09-07).

- **Every landscape appendix was sized for a portrait page (tier M, 2026-09-07).**
  Column widths were computed against `TEXT_WIDTH_PT` regardless of orientation, so
  Appendices B, C, D and E were squeezed into two-thirds of the page they print on —
  and the Baron's applied-wing-load table fell below its own floor for want of space
  that was there all along. The landscape width is now measured (652.85pt of
  `\linewidth`, not the 719.9pt the paper size suggests: `includeheadfoot` takes the
  running head and footer out of the block), and a section's orientation is inherited by
  its subsections, where the appendix tables actually live.

- **`fancyhdr` warned once per page that the running head did not fit (tier S,
  2026-09-07).** 77 identical warnings on the report's own example, in both report
  renderers, because a `\small` head is taller than the 12pt default `\headheight`.
  Declared.

- **The column widths were modelled; they are measured now (tier M, 2026-09-07).** The
  solver sized every column from a four-class glyph model — upper, lower, digit, narrow
  — scaled off a 0.5 em average, and a model is only as good as its worst word. Its
  worst word was `assumed`: 34.02pt of Latin Modern against a predicted 30.24, so the
  Spars column of Table 12 was floored 3.8pt under the one token it had to hold and
  every row of it overprinted. The floor test passed throughout, because it checked the
  solver against the same wrong ruler the solver used. Every printable ASCII character,
  roman and bold, was set by `tectonic` on this module's own preamble and its `\wd`
  read back; the two table sizes are one font, so their ratio is exact as well (1.0811,
  against the 5.0/4.5 assumed). Summing the measured glyphs reproduces a real word to a
  hundredth of a point, and a new gate holds the tables to eight of TeX's own readings.
  `ga6_normal`, `baron_58` and `concept_regional_jet` now build with **no warnings at
  all**, against 33 overfull boxes plus 77 `fancyhdr` on `ga6_normal` alone before.

- **The single-owner constant guard read a glyph width as the dynamic-pressure divisor
  (tier S, 2026-09-07).** `\b295\b` treats a decimal point as a word boundary, so it
  matched the `295` inside `6.295` and reported the renderer for open-coding
  `DYNAMIC_PRESSURE_DIVISOR`. Every literal in the guard now has to *start* a number
  rather than be a run of digits taken out of the middle of one.

- **Report renderer: table splitting, figure lists and marker legends (tier S, 2026-08-30).**
  Three defects found by reading compiled PDFs during the oracle-report GUI review, all in
  the renderer shared with the summary report.
  A table short enough to fit a page is now set as one unbreakable `[H]` float instead of a
  `longtable`: `longtable` split the Baron's five-row Mach table between its last row and
  `\endlastfoot` and printed the repeated header and bottom rule alone at the top of the
  next page, under no data — a break no inter-row penalty prevents, because the foot is not
  a row. Tables past `latex.UNBREAKABLE_ROWS` still use `longtable`, because a hundred-row
  case index has to break somewhere.
  `figure_tex` emits `\caption[<title>]{<title>: <caption>}`, so the List of Figures carries
  titles rather than four near-identical explanatory paragraphs.
  The marker-series legend moved from a hard-coded "Design CG cases" in the emitter to
  `PlotData.points_label`, which had the oracle report's gust design points inheriting a
  legend naming a different figure.

- **A deleted row is the row the button names (#153, tier M, 2026-08-30).**
  The per-row delete in the oracle form removed the *last* row rather than the one
  it named: clicking "Delete row 2 · aileron" on `ga6_normal` removed `flap`. The
  deletion always reached the project — what undid it was the render that
  followed. A row widget keys itself by row index and Streamlit's retained state
  outvotes the value seeded from the model, so every row below the deleted one was
  renumbered onto its neighbour's state and the tail of the table was typed back
  over itself one place up. `_retire_renumbered_rows` now retires the state of the
  rows a deletion renumbers, and only those: a row above the deletion did not move
  and keeps an edit typed in the same interaction as the click. Swept across both
  table shapes — the flat grid is one `st.data_editor` whose pending edits are an
  index-keyed map, and a polyline inside a renumbered row had a cached frame
  drawing the row that used to be there. Unreachable before this milestone, which
  gave `ga6_normal` seven surfaces where every fixture had held two.

- **The notes directory and the backlog agree with reality at the 0.8.2 cut
  (issue #190, tier S, 2026-09-08).** The 2026-09-04 project review's direct
  answer to "the backlog and notes are bloated and uncoordinated", taken in one
  pass ahead of the cut. Status headers: notes 46, 47 and 50 now say SHIPPED
  with the step that shipped them (50 was found stale by the same sweep — the
  issue predated it), note 48 says its 0.8.2 half shipped and note 49 carries
  OR-85/86, and note 44 says every agreed iteration through §22 is built rather
  than "nothing built". Archived to `docs/40_history/` under their own numbers
  (the notes-35–43 precedent): 09, 11, 24, 32, 34, 45, 46, 47, 48 and 50, with
  every inbound link in docs, code docstrings and tests re-pointed — except the
  two in frozen `sloads/modules/` docstrings (`tail_span.py`, `balance.py`),
  which are left stale rather than edited without an OR-15 admission.
  `00_backlog.md`'s "Where things stand (2026-08-29)" narrative and the five
  superseded stacked re-cut preambles rolled to
  `40_history/44_backlog_state_narrative_to_2026-08-29.md` per the file's own
  2026-08-16 precedent; the live table apparatus (system of record, ordering
  rules, removal rule, review additions, the priority table) stays. Note 03's
  dead "Phase G" backlog pointer re-aimed at the #29/0.9.0 band; note 01
  carries a phase-complete banner. The six #29-pre-assigned parked rows
  (M4-11b, L-8b/c/d/e/f) moved into the backlog's 0.9.0 band with bodies and
  filed as #247–#252 by the bridge, so `02_parked.md` again means off-mission
  only. Rule-6 numbers stated on the
  parks that lacked them: M4-19 and M4-21 park at **0** (the term is off by
  default / evaluates to zero on every emitted balanced trim point), and M4-4
  gets its measured pair — the Ch 9 `Iyy` approximation is +32 % over the
  per-CG precise value on `ga6_normal` and +123 % on `baron_58`, conservative
  in sign and oracle-locked, which is the pair that parks it. The step-14
  indeterminate-path mention gained the stub body it never had. The milestone
  half of the issue (thirteen unmilestoned defects, #171) was closed by the
  owner in the 2026-09-08 review session; the remaining milestone assignments
  and the `_staging_tmp2/` deletion are the owner's `gh`/local actions.

- **The three-view draws the fin's loads reference axis in the side view, not
  the top (tier S, 2026-09-08, found at the §3.5 pre-release walk).** The
  Configuration & Layout LRA overlay looped over every WINGGEOM surface and
  drew each into the Top view, treating the polyline's second coordinate as a
  butt line — but a vertical surface's second coordinate is a **waterline**
  (the GA6 fin root is `(240.912, 117.0)`), so the fin's and rudder's LRA
  rendered in the x-y plane, off past the wingtip. Worse latent on `baron_58`:
  its fin sets `symmetric=True`, which the loop would mirror about y=0,
  hanging a second fin below the airplane — the same trap the oracle report's
  planform figures already ruled on (the frame decides, never `symmetric`).
  The frame logic now has one owner, `configuration.lra_overlays` — vtail and
  rudder go to the Side view (X vs waterline), never mirrored; planform
  surfaces keep the Top view with the symmetric mirror — and the view consumes
  it. `sloads/modules/configuration.py` is frozen (note 44 OR-13): edited
  under an owner OR-15 admission granted 2026-09-08, scoped to one additive
  function and its import, recorded on the manifest hash in
  `tests/test_frozen_set.py`. Guarded
  (`test_configuration.py::test_lra_overlay_puts_a_waterline_span_surface_in_the_side_view`);
  proven both ways — forcing every surface into the Top frame fails the guard.

- **The nose gear's critical ground case was never reported (design note 44 OR-185, tier L, 2026-09-07).**
  `landing._critical` ranked each FAR family on `max(main-wheel resultant,
  nose-wheel resultant)` and returned one case. That is not a tie-break between
  two candidates for one title — it is a comparison between two different gears,
  and the loser's larger reaction on the *other* gear was discarded. On every
  shipped example the two-wheel level landing won 23.479(a) on main-wheel load,
  so the **three-wheel level landing never appeared as a critical case** although
  its nose reaction is the largest of the family (1786.8 lb on `ga6_normal`,
  4194.3 on `baron_58`, 8178.8 on `concept_regional_jet`) — and it is the
  condition the fuselage section's own advisory sends a reader to the landing
  section to find. Each family is now ranked once per gear it loads, and the
  shipped condition set goes from 40 to 42.
- **A multi-engine load-case index placed one engine's loads at the other engine's butt line (OR-193).**
  Two of the six engine-mount conditions — the 23.361(b)(1) sudden-stoppage torque
  and the 23.371(b) gyroscopic condition — carry no `loc_*` values while the four
  beside them for the same engine do, and `load_cases_to_rows` filled the gap
  with the **first** location in the whole set. So the right-hand engine's
  stoppage torque and its four gyroscopic sub-cases were published at the
  left-hand engine's station: ten rows on `atr42_100` and `dhc8_dash8`, fifteen
  on `concept_regional_jet`, each a real load on the wrong side of the airplane.
  A condition with no location of its own now takes the point of the condition it
  follows, which is that engine's. The producer stating the point on every
  condition it emits is the proper repair and is filed: `modules/engine.py` is
  frozen for 0.8.2.
- **Seven markdown emphasis markers were reaching the printed page, and the class had no guard.**
  `latex.py` has no `**` → `\textbf` conversion and never had one, so a marker
  written into a figure caption, a table note or a body paragraph is always a
  literal artefact. Section 12 shipped seven and the previous iteration's were
  caught by eye, which is what makes it a class rather than a slip. Stripped, and
  swept: no rendered oracle document on any shipped report may contain `**` or a
  non-ASCII character, asserted over every section, caption, note and appendix.
- **`backlog_issues.py create` filed 19 duplicate issues for rows that already named their own.**
  The bridge's two halves disagreed: `rewrite_backlog` has always skipped a line
  carrying `(#N)`, while `create` consulted only the persisted map — which is
  keyed on a **truncated title**, so rewording a row made its key miss and the
  row was filed again. One run on 2026-09-07 opened #194–#208 and #211–#214 for
  rows whose own text named their number in the line the parser had just read,
  plus three issues titled from parser fragments (`"#170"`, `"#171"`,
  `"Overtaken by note 49, close on GitHub:"`). `Item` now carries the number its
  line already states, `create` adopts it instead of filing, a defect bullet
  whose heading is only a pointer adopts the issue it names, and a heading ending
  in a colon is a lead-in rather than a defect. The map is re-pointed at the
  numbers the backlog states and every promoted defect bullet now carries its
  own `(#N)` in the file, so the record is self-describing and the cache can be
  rebuilt from it rather than trusted. The measure of the fix: run against a
  **wiped** map the bridge would now file **three** items — two defect bullets and
  the D-5 design decision, none of which the backlog stamps — where the same file
  produced 32, and **no table row** among them, which is the half that mattered.
  (Corrected 2026-09-07: this fragment first said *one* item, counting only the
  decision.) The
  22 spurious issues are closed, each pointing at the one it duplicates. Three
  guards, one of them asserting the cache has not drifted from the record.

- **Every h-tail load station printed the wing-root waterline as an airplane
  coordinate (#236, 2026-09-08 review R12, tier M, 2026-09-08).**
  The GA-6 report printed WL 78.5 — the wing root — for every h-tail station in
  §5.1 and Appendix D under a note calling the point airplane axes, while the
  airplane's h-tail sits at WL 111; an analyst importing the points placed the
  tail 32.5 in low with no way to know. The number was `tail_span`'s documented
  placeholder (z enters no load for a surface that loads in fz only), and the
  filed 0.8.2 scope was a disclosure sentence — the owner widened it (option B,
  OR-15 admission over `sloads/modules/tail_span.py`): `LayoutInput.h_tail_z`,
  until now a three-view sketch offset, is a real analysis input read by the
  new single owner `tail_geometry.h_tail_waterline` (fin tip on a T-tail,
  mid-fin on a defaulted cruciform — the deck used the wing root there, below
  the drawn surface — `root_waterline_z + h_tail_z` where entered, the
  wing-root plane marked ASSUMED with a loud note otherwise).
  `tail_span._h_tail_waterline` is a thin reader of it, so §5.1's station
  table, Appendix D and the exported GRIDs all moved together; both tables now
  carry a provenance sentence built from the same owner
  (`oracle_sections._htail_waterline_sentence`), so the document cannot claim
  a placement the resolution did not make. `ga6_normal` enters 32.5 and
  `baron_58` 13.0 (their own h-tail mass items); `cessna_210`/`concept_heavy`
  stay blank and print the ASSUMED disclosure. No delivered load moved — z
  pairs with the force components the surface does not carry. Register rule
  added (ORACLE_REPORT.md §3.6). Guards, all bite-proven: the owner's entered/
  assumed/fin-tip branches, a three-view-vs-load-path drift guard (the fin's
  twin), and the report's two-direction guard — the GA-6 must print 111.0 with
  the entered sentence, and the GA-6 with `h_tail_z` blanked (the reviewed
  state) must print 78.5 with the ASSUMED not-the-true-waterline sentence in
  both tables.

- **A test's monkeypatch of `io.default_projects_dir` leaked into later tests
  (tier S, 2026-09-08).** `tests/test_app_shell.py`'s `_NAMED_SCRIPT` (the
  #65/PB-6 save tests) replaced `sloads.io.default_projects_dir` with a lambda
  returning the test's `tmp_path` and never put it back — the same script's
  `try/finally` restored `st.download_button` but not this. Streamlit's
  `AppTest` runs the script in the test process, so the patch survived for the
  rest of the xdist worker's life, and whenever the scheduler later placed
  `test_io.py::test_default_projects_dir_is_repo_relative` on that worker it
  read the leaked temp dir: the CI failures on the #234/#235/#236 pushes
  (`assert 'test_open_re...' == 'projects'`), green locally only because the
  scheduling differs. The original is now captured before the patch and
  restored in the same `finally`. Proven by running the polluting and polluted
  tests in one process: fails without the restore, passes with it. The sweep
  found no other unrestored module-attribute patch in the test tree.

- **The report GUI stated the retired deselection behavior, and two provenance
  sentences pointed at the retired input echo (#237, 2026-09-08 review G2+G3,
  tier S, 2026-09-08).** The report page's selection caption promised the
  safeguard the document deliberately does not provide — "a deselected section
  is still printed, stating that it was excluded" — where the agreed, guarded
  rule (ORACLE_REPORT.md §3.1) is silent omission with renumbering; it now
  states that rule and its rationale. Two pointers survived OR-194's retirement
  of the input echo: the printed fingerprint caption ("the input echo remains
  the definitive record", `oracle_latex.py`) and the provenance banner's
  mismatch message ("read the input echo to see what moved", `fingerprint.py`);
  both now name the packaged `project.json`, OR-194's machine-readable record.
  Two docstring-only mentions swept by hand (`models/report.py`,
  `oracle_sections.py`). Guard: G-OR-74 gained a retired-claims scan ("input
  echo" banned in both rendered documents and the GUI literal sweep), the sweep
  now reads `oracle_app/report.py` (the milestone's new page — not under the
  OR-13 freeze, unlike the rest of the tree), the mismatch message is asserted
  at its owner, and a quoted witness proves the new pattern bites.

- **Planform provenance was fixed text, able to say "entered" over a derived
  planform (#235, 2026-09-08 review R11, tier S, 2026-09-08).**
  The reviewed reports got it wrong in both directions: GA-6's §2.1 prose said
  "generated" over entered polylines (that leg fell with #234, which replaced
  the parametric cross-check condition in §2.1), and the reviewed Baron report
  derived both tail planforms yet said "entered" in every caption — polylines
  the Baron example has since gained with #160's real tail geometry, so the
  fixture no longer reproduces it. The structural defect remained: the words
  lived in independent fixed strings ("as entered … entered vertices" in the
  planform and LRA figure captions, the "cannot be drawn as entered" refusals,
  the pressure-locator opening, the §2.1 DERIVED prose) with only the
  "Planform basis" table row actually consulting the supplied-flag. One
  wording owner now (`oracle_sections._PROVENANCE_WORD`, keyed on
  `_planform_assumed`, which asks `resolve_tail_planform`): the basis rows,
  both caption families, the refusals and the prose all build their word from
  it, so a caption cannot claim a provenance the flag does not. Register rule
  added (ORACLE_REPORT.md §2.1). Guard: both directions — GA-6 (supplied)
  must say "entered" with no DERIVED claim, and the Baron stripped of its
  tail surfaces (the reviewed state) must say DERIVED in the basis rows,
  absent-figure reasons and prose with no "entered" claim; proven to bite on
  a re-fixed basis row.

- **ORACLE_REPORT.md's register had fallen three shipped iterations behind, and
  carried entries later decisions had inverted (#238, 2026-09-08 review, tier S,
  2026-09-08).** The standard had no section for Section 11 OEI (note 44 §21),
  Section 12 Landing Gear (§22) or Appendix A as the V-n condition register
  (§23) — all AGREED and shipped — and its §7 register and §8 conformance list
  cited none of their guard modules; §3.11–§3.13 are now written from the
  iterations' SHALLs, with register rows and conformance entries, and §3.4's two
  stray OR-194 bullets moved into §3.13. Three stale entries were corrected to
  the current rulings ("reserved, unreferable Appendix A" → the slot OR-194
  filled; "carries the `-ULT` marker" → LIMIT with the factor stated, per
  OR-116; the pre-OR-59 single-table Appendix B → B.2 beside B.1), and §3.6's
  `Fz`-only Appendix D column set now defers to §3.8's thirteen-column applied
  spine, which amended it. The rule-4 sweep caught the same classes elsewhere:
  §3.1's selection scope still offered the retired input echo, §5 still called
  the echo "the record of what was analysed" (now the packaged `project.json`),
  and `models/report.py` still claimed a deselected section is rendered with
  its exclusion stated. Guard: `test_doc_currency.py` now requires every
  shipped `test_oracle_report*.py` module to be cited by the standard — the
  direction the existing dead-citation guard did not check, and the one that
  failed (five modules were uncited: `_oei`, `_landing`, `_vn`, `_vtail`,
  `_applied`) — with a meta-test proving it bites.

- **The SI issue carried Imperial residue a reader could not tell from carve-outs (#232, 2026-09-08 review R8, tier S, 2026-09-08).**
  The conversion owner was missing three rows — `ft^2`, `lb/ft^2` and `ft/s`
  passed through `convert_results` unconverted — so areas, wing loading,
  dynamic pressure and the sink rate wore Imperial labels beside converted
  neighbours; they now convert (`m²`, `kN/m²`, `m/s` — kN/m², not the
  design-pressure load label kPa, because the unit string is what
  `is_load_unit` discriminates on and wing loading must not grow a factor
  column). Table 7's second inertia channel, whose "(lb-in^2)" is baked into
  the frozen module's labels, printed four kg·m² values as lb-in^2; the SI
  issue prints one channel and its intro says why. §4.1's mass account quoted
  the calc's Imperial diagnostic ("5990.0 lb of items" beside a kg table) —
  `MassCheck` now carries its named parts and the report restates the account
  through the units owner; the carry-through stations go through the length
  channel. The OEI input table's IZZ converts, "per inch of span" is per unit
  span, and the limitations statement is built for the issue's own system, so
  an SI report no longer advertises `lbs-ULT` markers none of its files
  carry. Guard: a document-wide sweep of both examples' SI builds bans every
  Imperial token outside the stated carve-outs (altitude in ft beside KEAS,
  and 23.473(d) quoted in its own units), with the carve-outs stripped before
  the scan so they cannot shelter a residue.

- **Four process-doc corrections from the 2026-09-04 project review (issue
  #189, tier S, 2026-09-08).** (1) `00_backlog.md`'s head no longer keeps a
  prose list of live design notes — the guarded `docs/00_INDEX.md` is the
  index; the list had already drifted once (closed 09 listed, 45–49 omitted).
  (2) `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §5's "`30_future/` holds only `00_backlog.md`,
  the live notes, and nothing else" now names what the directory actually
  holds: the plan files and `02_parked.md` too. (3) `GIT_FLOW_GUIDE.docx` is
  demoted from `10_standard/` to
  `docs/40_history/49_git_flow_guide_to_2026-08-16.docx` — it advertised the
  squash flow the process retired at the 0.7.2 cut, and a binary doc's currency
  rests on a prose promise no test can check (precedent CR-D-4); its
  `WORKFLOW_COMMANDS.txt` INDEX row's stale "merge-commit PR" phrase is swept
  to rebase-merged in the same pass. (4) `00_program_overview.md`'s "`io.py` is
  the only place dataclasses meet JSON/CSV" is scoped to calc dataclasses —
  `sloads/export/` writes the deliverable files and always has. Guarded
  (`test_doc_currency.py::test_the_standard_tree_holds_only_guardable_text_formats`):
  a non-`.md`/`.txt` file in `docs/10_standard/` fails CI. Proven both ways: a
  scratch `.docx` dropped into the tree fails the guard.

- **The sudden-stoppage torque was cited under the gyroscopic regulation
  (tier S, 2026-09-08).** Five prose sites attributed the engine sudden-stoppage
  torque condition to 23.371(c) — but 14 CFR 23.371 is the gyroscopic and
  aerodynamic engine-mount section and has no such paragraph; sudden stoppage
  is 23.361(b)(1), as the emitting module (`modules/engine.py`), the case-title
  map (`report/oracle_sections.py`) and `safety_factors.py` all already state.
  Corrected in the `_running_locations` docstring (`report/render.py`), the
  G-OR-138 guard's docstring (`tests/test_oracle_report_vn.py`), backlog row 38
  (the #210 producer repair) and the two OR-193 change fragments awaiting the
  0.8.2 cut. The neighbouring "gyroscopic condition of 23.371(b)" citation was
  checked against its owner and is correct. No behavior change; every code
  `far_reference` was already right.

- **The release tag now waits for the merge push's full-matrix run on `main`
  (issue #184, tier S, 2026-09-08).** The 3.10/3.11 compatibility legs and the
  coverage floor run only on the push to `main`, "fixed forward" — but
  `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §4 step 4 tagged immediately after the merge with no
  requirement that that run was green, and 0.8.0 was tagged while it was red
  at install (#132; the classifier half was fixed then, this is the
  tag-on-red half). Step 4 now instructs
  `scripts/branch_protection_snapshot.py --check-main-run` before tagging —
  the new mode lives beside `--check` because both need the `gh` credential
  CI does not have (that script's founding constraint) — and it refuses a red
  **or still-in-progress** newest run on `main`, since tagging before the
  matrix finishes is the same hole with better luck.
  `tests/test_ci_conformance.py` gains the credential-free hop: §4 step 4
  must name `--check-main-run` and the script must offer it, so neither can
  be edited away without the other noticing. Proven both ways: removing the
  name from the doc fails the guard.

- **The saved-projects list no longer crashes on an unreadable folder.**
  `list_saved_projects` guarded a *missing* projects directory but not one that
  exists and cannot be read, so a projects folder in a macOS TCC-protected
  location (`~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, `~/Downloads`) raised `PermissionError`
  straight through the sidebar render. A directory this process cannot read now
  reports as holding no projects, which is the question the sidebar is asking.

- **The report stamped a stale sloads version.** The provenance stamp read
  `importlib.metadata`, which reports the version recorded in `PKG-INFO` when the
  package was *installed* — so in an editable checkout every report built after
  the 0.8.1 bump stated 0.8.0 until somebody reinstalled, naming a build it did
  not come from. The version now has one owner, `sloads/_version.py`:
  `pyproject.toml` declares it dynamic and reads that attribute, and so does the
  report generator, so an edit is in effect immediately and the two cannot
  disagree. Release note: the bump target is now `sloads/_version.py`, not
  `pyproject.toml`.

- **The vertical tail is placed by its own geometry, and placed once (#160,
  tier L, 2026-09-06).** `tail_geometry.fin_root_waterline` asks the entered
  `vtail` polyline first: it states the fin's placement directly, in the
  waterline datum the rest of the geometry is entered in, where every branch
  below it reconstructs that placement from something else. The explicit
  `vtail_root_waterline_z` is not a typed override of it (note 36 OV-1) but a
  second spelling of one measurement, so a disagreement is resolved to the
  polyline and `FinRoot.note` names the value it did not use — stated in band
  rather than refused, because the scalar is a shipped input field and has to
  stay typable. Guard: no shipped project may carry a disagreeing pair.

- **`ga6_normal`'s fin was modelled 33 in low for 20 days (#160, tier L,
  2026-09-06).** It carried `vtail_root_waterline_z = 78.5` — the airplane's
  *wing* root waterline, entered 2026-08-17 as note 19 §10.2 step (i)'s
  "zero-movement change that pins today's assumed value as a stated one" so that
  step (ii)'s body outline would have an attributable digest wave. Step (ii)
  shipped in the same pass and could never take effect: `explicit` led the
  resolution order, so the pin shadowed both the outline it was scaffolding for
  (98.44) and the fin's own entered edges (111.5), while reporting itself
  `assumed=False`. The pin is cleared. The fin's roll arm `z_fin − z_cg` goes
  11.89 → 44.89 in and the four lateral cases' roll accelerations move 5–12×
  (`SUDDEN RUDDER` −6.888 → −85.952 deg/s²), yaw ~2 % through `Ixz`. The fin
  load and `n_y` are bit-identical on every fixture, which is the check that a
  lever arm moved and not the aerodynamics. No Appendix A oracle moves — the
  lateral cases have no printed oracle and are pinned by measurement.

- **Five fins were entered symmetric, and were each reported at twice their own
  size (#160, tier L, 2026-09-06).** `baron_58`, `cessna_210`, `atr42_100`,
  `dhc8_dash8` and `concept_regional_jet` set `symmetric: true` on a vertical
  tail. `wing_geometry.surface_properties` reads that flag for the area/span/AR
  bookkeeping, so each fin was reported at `2 × area` and `2 × span` against its
  own entered scalars (`baron_58` 48.58 ft², span 132.0, AR 2.49 against an
  entered 24.30, 66.0, 1.26) — and `airloads.resolve_aero_surfaces` reads the
  same flag as *the* predicate for "is this a lifting surface AIRLOADS
  analyses", so every one of the five also shipped a **Schrenk symmetric
  spanwise lift distribution for its fin**, computed on the doubled aspect ratio
  and printed under `FAR 23.301`. Both are gone. The guard checks the reported
  geometry against the entered scalars rather than the flag, so it is the same
  gate the day someone reaches the same wrong number another way.

- **The same five fins were entered root-relative (#160, tier L, 2026-09-06).**
  Their polylines were based at waterline 0 while the load path placed each fin
  on the body, so §2.1 drew every one on the airplane centreline — 110 in low on
  `baron_58`. Each is rebased onto its own resolved root (`baron_58` 110.0
  entered; `cessna_210` 100.2, `atr42_100` 191.2 and `dhc8_dash8` 203.5 from
  their own fuselage outlines; the RJ's 87.0 from the T-tail relation, exact).
  One convention now: **a fin polyline's second coordinate is a waterline in the
  airplane datum**, which is how `ga6_normal` always entered its own.

- **The surface has one name: the vertical tail (owner ruling, tier S,
  2026-09-06).** "v-tail" where space requires, `vtail` as the code token —
  matching the regulation, the schema, the component key and what the reports
  already print. Stated in `CONVENTIONS.md` §7.2, because today the *data* is
  spelled `vtail_*` while the owners that place and load it are spelled `fin_*`,
  which is one thing under two names inside one call chain. The identifier sweep
  is filed for the 0.8.2 cut (it reaches frozen `modules/tail_span.py`); new code
  takes the agreed name from the first line.

- **The exported wing deck's torsion is applied, not differenced (design note 46, tier L, 2026-09-03).**
  `sbeam_bridge.wing_nodal_loads` built its `MOMENT` cards by differencing the
  cumulative `Myy` between adjacent stations. That column already contains the
  sweep and dihedral transfer of the shear carried outboard, so a solver
  applying the card at a point — and generating the transfer itself, from the
  geometry — counted the transfer twice. Under the rigid-body accumulation a
  solver performs, the exported wing torsion was wrong by **151 / 190 / 120 %**
  on `ga6_normal` (PHAA / TORS / ACRL) and **34 / 21 %** on `baron_58`; shear
  and both bending columns closed exactly, which is why the error survived a
  full closure sweep. The nodal set is now the **applied** set on the deck's
  nodes — each strip's own `fx`, `fz` and free torsion `myy_free` at its own
  point, each concentrated wing mass reduced to the node inboard of it as its
  force plus the **full** three-component `r × F` offset couple (the couple's
  torsion member is the one the differencing had been supplying wrong). It
  reproduces the published `Sx`, `Sz`, `Mxx`, `Myy` and `Mzz` at **every**
  station of every case of both example airplanes to ~1e-15 relative. `FORCE`
  cards are unchanged — a strip's own load and the difference of the cumulative
  shear are the same number — so only `MOMENT(My)` moves. The deck's
  equilibrium claim strengthens with it: the wing now asserts the full
  rigid-body `m.y`, where before only the bare card sum `m0.y` could be
  asserted and `equilibrium.py` recorded the weaker claim as a convention.
  Side-of-body internal and collapsed loads state their torsion about a shared
  reference point (`sob_reference_point`), which a free-moment card set makes
  load-bearing where a differenced one did not.

- **Concentrated wing masses are published as applied point loads (#166, tier L, 2026-09-03).**
  `WINGINER` adds each concentrated wing mass — engine, gear, fuel, a store — to the
  cumulative shears, bending and torsion of every station inboard of it, and leaves the
  per-strip `Fz`/`Fx` panel-only. The mass was therefore published nowhere as an *applied*
  load, so any set of strip loads handed to a structural model was short by the whole of it:
  on `examples/baron_58.project.json` PHAA, **4,821.5 lb of a 5,004.1 lb root shear**, exactly
  the load factor times the four entered masses. It is inertia relief, so the omission is
  unconservative in shear and, with the masses at 57-95 in span, substantially so in root
  bending. `WingLoadResult` now carries a `point_loads` list of `ConcentratedLoad`, each a
  pure force at its own `X`, `Y`, `Z` — a concentrated mass has no free moment, since every
  moment it produces is that force acting through an arm the geometry already states.

- **`WingStationLoad.myy_free` is populated by the wing chain (tier L, 2026-09-03).**
  The field existed and was left `0.0`, so the free per-strip torsion had to be reconstructed
  from the cumulative column by undoing the sweep and dihedral transfer. That reconstruction is
  exact for an air load and **wrong** once a concentrated mass steps the shear — the step is
  not a transfer, so it lands in the recovered free moment as a spurious term. It is now
  published at source: the section pitching moment from `AIRLOADS`, the panel mass' 50%-chord
  offset from `WINGINER`, summed by `NETLOADS` and shifted with the reference axis on the
  strip's own force. No cumulative value moves and no oracle is affected.

- **WINGGEOM is no longer described as a strip integrator (#155, tier M, 2026-08-30).**
  The closed-form planform integration shipped earlier in 0.8.2 left the surrounding
  prose behind: `wing_geometry`'s own module docstring still taught the strip method
  its `surface_properties` had stopped using, and `configuration` reported
  MAC/XLEMAC/AR as coming "via the WINGGEOM strip integrator" — a note the oracle
  report reproduces verbatim in §2.1. Corrected everywhere the claim appears
  (`wing_geometry`, `configuration`, `airloads`, `models/inputs`, three test headers,
  `PROGRAM_SPEC.md`, `00_theory_sources.md`, `01_concept_loads_plan.md`), while
  statements about strips that are still true — AIRLOADS' own span loop, the spanwise
  load stations, `tail_geometry` — were left standing.
- **The WINGGEOM surface table reports `Load stations`, not `Integration elements`
  (tier M, 2026-08-30).** `elements` is the user's spanwise load-station count and no
  longer drives any integral, so the row now says what it is (key
  `integration_elements` → `load_stations`; nothing read it). No number changes.
- **The Appendix A aileron is a tight oracle again (tier M, 2026-08-30).** Its ±2 %
  band existed only because the strip sum's result depended on an element count the
  manual never tabulates. Closed-form integration reaches area 932, MAC 11.645 and
  AR 7.036 within 0.037 %, so the tolerance returns to the suite's ±0.1 %.

### Removed

- **`SurfaceInput.front_spar_pct` / `.rear_spar_pct` (design note 50, tier L, 2026-09-05).**
  Replaced by the entered station, not kept beside it: two stored fields for one
  quantity with only one of them on the page is the duplicate-owner shape this
  project removes rather than marks. The **v60 → v61** hop is the first in the
  live chain that converts a value rather than being an identity — a file that
  *entered* a fraction has its station computed from that airplane's own
  polylines, so a carry-through survives the hop as the same physical station
  instead of reverting to the (also changed) default. All seven bundled examples
  wrote both keys `null`, so no fixture data moved (OR-124, OR-127).

## [0.8.1] — 2026-08-29

### Breaking

- **Python 3.10 is the floor; the 3.9 claim is dropped (#132, tier M,
  2026-08-28).** The 0.8.0 cut shipped `requires-python >= 3.9` beside
  `streamlit >= 1.51` — and every Streamlit release from 1.51 declares
  `Requires-Python >= 3.10`, so the first full-matrix run on `main` after the
  tag failed in `test (3.9)` at **install**: the resolver refused the floor the
  metadata claimed. The #129 floor bump verified the API the code calls but not
  the floor's own interpreter support against the CI matrix. Owner decision:
  drop 3.9 (EOL 2025-10; Streamlit dropped it at 1.51) rather than hold the
  floor at 1.50 and re-arm the deprecated `use_container_width` on the plotly
  sites. Ships: `requires-python >= 3.10`; classifiers and the `ci.yml`
  main-push matrix move to 3.10/3.11/3.12 together; every doc stating the
  matrix swept (rule 4). The structural half (rule 3):
  `tests/test_ci_conformance.py::test_the_python_support_claim_is_one_claim_in_three_places`
  — the classifier set **is** the full-matrix set (the mirror rule was a
  pyproject comment), the `requires-python` floor is the smallest tested leg,
  and both directions were verified to fail by mutation. The half no offline
  test reaches — whether the *dependencies'* `Requires-Python` admits the
  floor — is enforced by the full-matrix install on `main`, which is exactly
  where #132 surfaced. The py310 lint target's new churn rules (B905/RUF007)
  are parked beside `UP` as the same deliberate-churn class, with the reason
  in the config.

### Added

- **The GUI is walked end to end in CI, not just booted (#145, tier M,
  2026-08-29).** `tests/test_gui_journey.py` loads every bundled example, visits
  every `workflow.py` step in order carrying one session forward — widget state
  included — presses every Apply and re-enters every widget with the value it
  already holds, then runs every registered module. It asserts that no page
  raises, that every module runs clean or refuses by name with
  `MissingInputError`, and that the project is **byte-identical** across the
  whole walk, since nothing was entered anywhere in it. The release gate above
  it (`RELEASE_PROCESS` §3.5) booted both front-ends and checked the root page
  answered 200, which cannot reach a defect two pages downstream of an
  interaction — the shape of both post-0.8.0 escapes. §3.5 now names the journey
  and gains a short manual walkthrough as its second line. The accepted no-op
  Apply writes are the file's `KNOWN_OPEN` list, each carrying its #148 line and each
  asserted to still reproduce, so a carve-out cannot lapse into silence.

- **The delivered landing load is a body-frame force with a stated point, for every gear on every case (design note 38 GF-6/GF-7, issue #134, tier L, 2026-08-29).**
  LANDLOAD prints its whole reaction matrix twice — "VALUES ARE WITH RESPECT TO
  GROUND LINE -- DENOTED BY P (PRIME)" and "VALUES ARE WITH RESPECT TO AIRPLANE
  DATUM" — and the replication shipped the first set only: no application point,
  no attitude, no frame label, while the export deck consumed the other frame. A
  stress model consumes a force **and a point**; a magnitude in an unnamed frame
  is not a load.

  Every case now emits **three wheels — nose, left main, right main, all three
  always, an unloaded gear at zero rather than omitted** — each with the
  airplane-datum `Fx, Fy, Fz`, the **location `x, y, z`** it acts at, and the
  gear reference node it is delivered to, with the strut state and Appendix A's
  own point-of-load column named in the condition note (axle on cases 1–12 and
  25/26/28/29/31/32, ground contact on 13–24 and 27/30/33 — design note 39). It
  is built *from* `gear_loads.applied_wheels`, so the statement a stress model
  reads and the load the deck applies cannot come to differ.

  Also emitted, all new: p231's **fuselage-axis angle** per case (`deg`, an
  attitude and never a load), p232's **airplane-datum load factors NR/NV/ND**,
  and p233's **airplane-datum unbalanced moments**. Both GUIs gain the datum
  table beside the primed one.

- **Both frames are named on the value, and the delivered CSV carries only one of them (GF-6/GF-7, tier L, 2026-08-29).**
  New `sloads/frames.py` owns the frame vocabulary, the manual's own caption
  words, the report-vs-deliver rule and the rotation between the frames.
  `LoadValue` gains `frame` (schema **v57 → v58**, identity hop): the render
  boundary reads it to keep the delivered CSV in the airplane datum while the
  text report keeps both sets — drift-guarded both ways, so neither can leak
  into the other. Both GUIs caption their reactions tables from the one function
  that has the words, guarded against either spelling them out again.

- **72 more Appendix A cells locked (2026-08-29).** p232's NR/NV/ND columns join
  the page locks, transcribed at 200 dpi; the tail-down family reproduces all
  three printed cells exactly.

- **Appendix A's LANDLOAD output is legible, and every printed cell of it is now
  an oracle (tier M, 2026-08-29).** p231 (ground line), p232 (airplane datum)
  and p233 (limit unbalanced moments) had been recorded since 2026-08-15 as
  OCR-garbled and unusable, so cases 13–33 were held by internal identities and
  a handful of legible cells — the ONENGOUT precedent. The pages are garbled,
  not illegible: rendered at 200 dpi they read cleanly. All three tables are
  transcribed and locked for all 33 cases — reactions, resultants, side loads,
  the NVP/NDP/NS ground-line inertia factors and the pitch/roll/yaw unbalanced
  moments — at the page's own print resolution (±0.5 in an integer column,
  ±0.0005 in a three-decimal one, or ±0.1 %, whichever is looser):
  `test_landload_p231_ground_line_table`, `..._p232_airplane_datum_table`,
  `..._p233_unbalanced_moments_table`, which subsume the two narrower
  spot-check tests. LANDLOAD moves from partially to fully oracle-locked.
  Closes the open sub-finding on design note 38 §1.11 (the braked-roll and
  supplementary-nose families had no printed oracle on any fixture, which is
  why a 40 % move in them left the suite green) and supplies GF-3″ with the
  transcribed deviated-from set it is blocked on. No calc changes: the port
  already reproduced every cell.

### Changed

- **The standard and theory docs state what is, not how it got there (tier S,
  2026-08-29, issue #142).** Dated development narration audited out of the
  final-definition documents, where it had accumulated as each correction landed:
  `PROGRAM_SPEC.md` ("this gate was green throughout the year the transfer ran
  from the wrong point", a retired field name, three "until 2026-08-\*" behaviour
  notes), `CONVENTIONS.md` and `00_theory_sources.md` ("as the deck did until
  2026-08-29", "From 2026-08-15 this row recorded…", "what cost the module its
  oracle for a year"), `balanced_cases.md` (the "Updated 2026-08-29, twice"
  banner, now a standing note on the two conventions the table is read under) and
  `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` ("Until 2026-08-26 this bullet stated…"). Every
  **measured** effect stays and is now stated in the present tense as the evidence
  for the rule it justifies — the 524,302 lb-in patch moment, the 1,800 lb
  DB-total-over-MTOW bound, the 6.1 % `WR` overstatement, the −757.1 lb-in
  witness; the dates and the edit histories are already carried in full by the
  history entries for #133, #134, #135, #137 and #139, so nothing is lost.
  Swept as one class beyond the four lines the item named (practice 4).
  In the same pass, the superseded "considered and declined" `BETA(2)` entry in
  `02_approved_corrections.md` no longer contradicts itself: its inner annotation
  promised the entry would "convert in place" to an approved deviation "when
  issue #133 lands" — which it did not, a new entry supersedes it — against an
  outer banner stating it is kept verbatim. The annotation now records what met
  the reopening condition and marks the boundary the verbatim text begins at.

- **The guide's landing chapter describes the 0.8.1 landing output (tier S, 2026-08-29).**
  `docs/60_guide` had zero diff across v0.8.0..v0.8.1 while the landing
  deliverable was rebuilt underneath it: chapter 14's *Results on this page*
  still described the primed-only output — no body-frame three-wheel
  deliverable, no axle-vs-contact-point split, no statement of which frame the
  CSV is in, and no NR/NV/ND or fuselage-axis angle. It now describes what the
  page ships: the two frames and which one is delivered, the three wheels on
  every case with the force, the point it acts at and the reference node it is
  transferred to, the datum load factors and unbalanced moments, and the two
  approved p232 deviations a reader cross-checking against the book will meet
  (citing the register, not the development trail). Two new *Common mistakes*
  cover reading one frame's numbers as the other's and taking a reference node
  for a point of application.

  The guide's `03_conventions.md` gains the frame statement
  the chapter leans on — airplane datum as the delivered frame, ground line as
  the manual's analysis view, the rotation between them, and the point of
  application — plus the `Frame` and `Applied at` columns in the results-table
  and CSV sections, and the one place the text download carries more than the
  CSV.

- **An oracle cell says where its number came from, and a gate may not re-derive
  the rule it checks (#146, tier S, 2026-08-29).** The three worst defects the
  0.8.0 cut shipped share one mechanism rather than any error of physics — *the
  oracle silently shrank*: an illegible column was recorded as a missing oracle
  when it was an OCR failure over a legible page (#133), a fixture weight was
  back-solved from a mis-OCR'd cell and then used to check that cell (#137), and
  a gate moved the applied load from the tyre to the axle *inside the test*
  before comparing (#139). "An oracle test exists, ±0.1 %" is binary where two
  further facts decide whether the test can fail. `00_theory_sources.md` gains an
  **Oracle provenance and gate independence** section stating both as rules —
  **P-1**, every cell states *transcription* / *OCR extraction* / *absent — not
  printed* / *absent — illegible* / *back-solved*, with a back-solved value
  disqualified as the oracle for anything downstream of what it was solved from;
  and **P-2**, promoted from design note 39's G-AP-2, *two copies of one rule
  cannot disagree* — and `CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` Step 3 gains both as checklist
  items. With them, the bounded sweep the rules exist to make possible: every
  family with no printed oracle, classified by whether its gate has a witness
  independent of the code. `one_engine_out` is the exposed one — its gate reads
  the `ONENGOUT.BAS` listing the port was written from, so a change to it is
  unguarded until the Appendix B twin is in hand — and the `configuration` /
  `vn_diagram` / `validation` / airspeed closures are named as not-a-load and
  ranked accordingly. Nothing in the sweep is a defect; it is the statement the
  citations were missing. The "partially oracle-locked where the scan is
  OCR-garbled" bullet in the canonical oracle-status list, stale since LANDLOAD's
  three pages were transcribed, goes with it.

### Fixed

- **An Apply that entered nothing no longer creates a project slice, and a
  rebuild no longer drops what its form does not render (#145, tier M,
  2026-08-29).** #143 settled that an `Optional` record is created and removed by
  a named gesture; that fix was registry-driven and reached `oracle_app/` only.
  In the main GUI, pressing **Apply** on a page nobody had filled in wrote a whole
  zero-valued slice into the project and saved it into the `.project.json` —
  `aileron_loads`, `flap_loads`, `tab_loads`, `select_input`, `fuselage_mass`,
  `landing`, `one_engine_out`, `engine_layout` and the first engine.
  `app_shell/optional_slice.py` now owns the rule for this front-end — an Apply
  may fill a slice in and may empty one out, but it may not create one out of
  nothing — with the whole-GUI journey walk as its drift guard. A form whose
  whole subject *is* one optional block (the fuselage-moment and lateral-body-aero
  Applies) is unaffected: there the button is the named gesture.
  Swept with it (practice 4), three rebuilds that dropped fields their own form
  does not show: the Aero Apply destroyed a populated `lateral_body_aero` block
  outright and re-stamped `cruise.stall_cl` from CLmax (ga6 1.41 → 1.4068,
  atr42_100 1.55 → **2.009**, moving the FLTLOADS balance clamp on an Apply that
  entered nothing), the Payload Cases Apply deleted each case's
  `LoadingDefinition` (three of baron_58's six), and the engine form turned unset
  `Optional` power fields into a stated zero.

- **The delivered CSV states its frame and the point each force acts at (tier M,
  schema v59, 2026-08-29).** The landing CSV carried the application point
  **numerically only** — `x`/`y`/`z` per gear — while the word for it (`axle` vs
  `ground contact point`) and the "with respect to airplane datum" frame words
  lived in the condition note and the GUI captions, neither of which this channel
  carries. A standalone consumer could not tell case 1 acts at the axle except by
  comparing coordinates back to the geometry, and the two points are a rolling
  radius apart — a moment arm, not a label. `LoadValue` now carries `point`
  beside `frame` (vocabulary `gear_loads.POINTS`, owner `application_point_of`,
  design note 39 AP-1), the landing module stamps it per leg from Appendix A's
  own printed column, and `report.render.results_to_rows` emits both words in a
  `Frame` column and an `Applied at` column. The force row and the location row
  of a wheel name the point; the **reference-node** row names none, because the
  node is where the reaction is transferred *to*, not where it acts. Both are
  ordinary columns under the data-shaped floor, so the all-empty prune drops them
  from every module that names neither — five landing CSV digests move and no
  other channel changes. Schema hops v58 → v59 (identity: `""` means exactly what
  v58 meant), because `LoadValue` is persisted inside
  `critical.conditions[].loads` (issue #141).

- **A lift polynomial with no alpha lever is refused by name, not iterated into
  an opaque solver failure (#144, tier M, 2026-08-29).**
  `flight_envelope.balance_configs` — the choke point `build_envelope` and
  `trim_sweep` share — now refuses a coefficient set whose lift polynomial has
  no alpha term (`C1..C4` all zero), naming the set and the fix, beside the #81
  stall-CL, weightless-CG and tail-CP-at-datum refusals. The inner balance moves
  alpha until NZ lands in its ±0.005 band; with no alpha term CL (and with it
  LZ, MM and the tail load) is the same number at every alpha, so no trip can
  answer differently and the loop exhausted 400 of them, reporting "reached
  NZ=0 at alpha=41.3861 deg" — a solver failure naming no input, on a page that
  had been working a moment earlier. `AeroCoefficientsInput.normalize` fills a
  blank set's `stall_cl` from `clmax_flap`, so the #81 guard did not catch it.
  Only lift is guarded: an all-zero drag or moment polynomial is a legitimate
  entry, an all-zero lift polynomial says the set carries no airplane.

- **A printed load no longer hangs on the last ulp (#147, tier M, 2026-08-29).**
  `report/render.format_value` chose between two far-apart spellings — an
  integral value in full, everything else at four significant figures — on the
  raw double, so the printed cell was a discontinuous function of the last bit:
  `-687258.0` printed `-687258` while `-687257.9999999999`, the same load
  rotated through one more cosine, printed `-6.873e+05`. Both spellings shipped
  in one landing case of `concept_regional_jet`, and the wing area printed
  `71676` in one place and `7.168e+04` in another. Which spelling a cell took
  moved with the libm build — macOS and glibc disagree in the last ulp of
  `sin`/`cos` — so the frozen Imperial digest passed on the developer's Mac and
  failed on the Linux CI leg, red since 7cdc609 (#134) put the landing
  rotations in. The formatter now quantizes to twelve significant figures
  before choosing, four orders above a double's ulp and far below anything a
  load means. **The Imperial baseline was regenerated deliberately:** 67 lines
  across 22 channels of four examples, every one of them a near-integer joining
  its exact twin (`7.168e+04` → `71676`) or a four-significant-figure boundary
  settling on one side (`NV 1.668` → `1.669`). No calc changed; the Appendix A
  oracles and the twin closure suites are unmoved.

- **The GA6 light-landing weight is 2800 lb, and the braked-roll family gets its
  first printed-value oracle (tier M, 2026-08-29).** `ga6_normal`'s `fwd light`
  ground case weighed **2803 lb**, a figure back-solved in Step C10 from an
  Appendix A p231 cell OCR'd as 1864 (`½·1.33·W`). The rendered page prints
  **1862**, and `1862/0.665 = 2800.0` — WTENV's forward-regardless weight, which
  p230 prints and which `cg_cases.seed_landing_cases` already gives this case.
  Corrected, closing the +0.107 % residual left by #135 and making the ground
  `fwd light` case identical to the flight `CG3` point it has always been.
  Cases 15, 18, 23, 24 and 31–33 move by 3 lb (0.107 %); no other fixture is
  touched. With the weight right, `test_landload_braked_roll_printed_cells`
  locks cases 16/17 (VMP 2261 / DMP 1808.8) and case 18 (VMP 1862 / DMP 1490)
  plus its p232 airplane-datum pair (Fz 1733 / Fx 1638) at ±0.1 % — the first
  printed-value oracle the 23.493 family has ever carried, on a page
  `theory_sources.md` had recorded as unusable. New drift guard
  `test_a_seeded_fwd_light_case_weighs_what_the_seed_gives_it` pins every
  fixture's seeded light case to the seed's own anchor (a case stating an
  entered D-25 loading is exempt — `baron_58`'s is one); mutation-verified
  against the 2803 value.

- **The ground reaction is applied where Appendix A applies it, not at the tyre
  on every case (tier L, 2026-08-29).** `gear_loads.transfer_couple(patch, …)`
  was one call site for all 33 LANDLOAD cases, while the manual's own printed
  column applies cases 1–12 at the **axle** and 13–24 at the **ground contact
  point** — so the twelve landing cases carried a spurious `r × F` pitching
  moment into every balanced ground case, absorbed silently into the solved `q̈`.
  Found by an identity that never reads the point: `residual My − the G-7a lift
  moment == PITCHP`, LANDLOAD's own unbalanced moment. It closes to ≤62 lb-in at
  the printed column's point and misses by 20,964–665,862 lb-in at the other one,
  on all six bundled fixtures, splitting **exactly** where the column splits;
  clearest on ga6's LG-01/02/03, where `PITCHP` is exactly zero and the whole
  patch residual (−9,840.6 / −28,553.5 / −31,182.9 lb-in) was invented. The split
  is physical: level-landing drag is a spin-up load reacted through the bearing,
  braking torque is internal to the wheel/leg free body. `application_point` is
  the one owner (design note 39 AP-2), read by the transfer, the gear free-body
  report and the emitted location; `GearLegLoad`/`AppliedWheel` carry `point`
  beside `patch`, which stays reported as the gear-side geometry it always was.
  No reaction changes and no oracle moved: the forces are LANDLOAD's own, so
  every Appendix A lock passes unmodified. `LG-04`'s pre-closure `My` moves
  −179,232 → −158,271 lb-in and its `q̈` −1.925e-2 → −1.701e-2; the frozen
  Imperial digest and `balanced_cases.md` §9.5 move with them. New gate
  **G-AP-1** asserts the identity on every balanced ground case of every fixture
  at `1e-4 · n·W·MAC` (worst measured 2.65e-5), replacing both an arm correction
  the *test* used to make on cases 1–12/19–24 and the 5 % slack the braked-roll
  pitch line carried for the #133 sign error — every family now closes on one
  bound. **G-AP-2** locks the point against a transcription of the printed
  column; **G-AP-3** asserts the package builds an application point in exactly
  one place. Design note 39 (AP-1…AP-6, G-AP-1…G-AP-5), AGREED 2026-08-29.

- **LANDLOAD's airplane-datum lift term and moment transform carry the same wrong sign as `BETA` did (approved deviation, issue #134, tier L, 2026-08-29).**
  The third and fourth instances of the #133 sign class, in the two quantities
  that entry could not reach because neither was in sloads until now.
  `LANDLOAD.BAS` writes the datum drag load factor's lift term as
  `+LF*SIN(GRA)` and the datum moment transform as a rotation of `+GRA`, where
  the physics — and `ρ = −GRA`, and the deck's own ground lift (G-7a) — give the
  other sign. Neither is written longhand in the port: both rotate through the
  case's own **measured** `ρ`, so the corrected value is what a rotation gives
  rather than a sign somebody typed. Case 1's factors move from the printed
  3.287 / 3.216 / 0.679 to **3.269 / 3.216 / 0.585**. Registered in
  `docs/20_theory/02_approved_corrections.md`; no printed cell was unlocked and
  the locked count rose by 72.

- **The LANDLOAD case families and the frame rotation had drifted from the code that draws them (rule 4 sweep, 2026-08-29).**
  `GROUND_LIFT_CASES` / `GROUND_ONE_WHEEL_CASES` / `GROUND_SIDE_CASES` /
  `BALANCED_GROUND_CASES` lived in `modules/balance.py`, beside the deck that
  consumes them and away from `modules/landing.py`, which *is* the case
  numbering; `attitude_of` lived in `gear_loads`. All are now owned by
  `landing`, and the 23.485 pairing that `NS` and the deck each derived
  separately is one `side_partner`. `to_airplane_datum` / `to_ground_line` /
  the `ρ` measurement moved to `sloads/frames.py`, the module that names the two
  frames they rotate between.

- **LANDLOAD's `BETA` carried the wrong sign on the ground-roll and tail-down
  attitudes; the ground-roll families were levered and resolved off it (tier L,
  2026-08-29).** `BETA` is the resultant-to-FS angle, and Appendix A p234 states
  the rule in the drawing: `BETA = GAMMA − GROUND ANGLE`, with `GAMMA = 0` where
  the reaction is normal to the ground. `LANDLOAD.BAS` applies that to the level
  attitude only, writing `+GRA(2)` / `+GRA(3)` for the other two. Attitude 3
  negates it back at both its use sites and came out right; **attitude 2 negated
  it at neither**, so every braked-roll, side and supplementary-nose case took
  both its lever arms and its `PHIM`/`PHIN` from the wrong sign — and those are
  shipped ULTIMATE loads, carried into the exported ground `FORCE` cards and the
  gear reference-point loads. Corrected at the origin (`landing.py:229`), which
  is one line plus the `ap[1]` call site that read the literal `gra2`; attitude
  3's two compensating negations are removed as redundant, changing no number.
  Approved oracle deviation (design note 38 GF-1/GF-2′/GF-3″, AGREED; register
  `docs/20_theory/02_approved_corrections.md`), superseding the "considered and
  declined" decision of 2026-08-15. The evidence is the manual against itself:
  Appendix A's braked-roll construction figure **p235** prints lever arms of
  77.052 / 17.760 / 94.811 where its p230 **table** — program output — prints
  69.886 / 23.260 / 93.147, and flipping the one sign reproduces all three figure
  values exactly with `CP` untouched. The `ρ == −GRA` pin is **flipped, not
  deleted**, and now holds in every attitude against `ground_angles` directly
  (`test_rho_is_minus_the_ground_angle_in_every_attitude`), replacing a check
  that recovered its reference from the thing it checked. The p230/p231/p232/p233
  locks re-pin cell by cell with the printed values kept transcribed beside the
  corrected ones; `balanced_cases.md` §9.5 and the frozen Imperial digest move
  with them. Side-family body drag flips from +186 lb aft to −186 lb forward,
  which is what nose-up geometry demands.

- **The light landing loading no longer takes the gross-weight ratio (tier M, 2026-08-29).**
  `LANDLOAD.BAS` applies `WR = GW/MLW` to the two *max landing* loadings only — the
  third (light) loading is already below the landing weight and lines 860/870/900
  carry it bare. sloads applied `WR` to all three in the braked-roll loop, so
  **cases 15 and 18 were overstated by the ratio** (up to 6.1 % on the shipped
  fixtures; on the Appendix A GA6, VMP 1962.1 instead of 1864.0). Found reading
  Appendix A p231 against the module: the printed case-18 pair is VMP **1862** /
  DMP **1490**, and the p232 airplane-datum pair Fz **1733** / Fx **1638**. The
  same rule was already correct at the three other sites it appears (`WL(23)`,
  `WL(24)` and the 23.499 supplementary-nose branch), so the guard
  `test_the_light_loading_never_takes_the_gross_weight_ratio` pins all four at
  once rather than the one that was wrong. Affects every example with a distinct
  light loading and `WR > 1` (`ga6_normal`, `atr42_100`, `dhc8_dash8`,
  `baron_58`, `concept_regional_jet`); `cessna_210` has `WR = 1` and is unmoved.
  Deliverable ULTIMATE loads change, so the frozen Imperial digest baseline is
  regenerated with it.

- **A blank LIMNZ no longer resolves to zero through a half-entered planform
  (#122, tier M, 2026-08-29).** `engine.effective_engine`'s note 36 OV-7 derive
  — blank `limit_load_factor` → `design_speed_values(project).n`, added by
  C210-41 because a 0 LIMNZ silently zeroes every mount case — reads the wing
  planform through STRSPEED's area resolver, but wrapped the whole chain in
  `contextlib.suppress(ValueError)` under a comment about incomplete *speeds*.
  The suppress was wide enough to swallow the planform's own refusal, so a wing
  caught mid-entry (truncated polyline, swapped LE/TE, zero span — the #71
  mutation set) handed the mount loads LIMNZ = 0 with no typed value on the page
  to show what had gone wrong: C210-41's failure mode restored, silently, by the
  guard meant to prevent a traceback. The derive now asks the precondition's
  owner (`derived_geometry.planform_area_sqft`) before the suppress, so an
  unresolvable planform propagates as the named refusal every other geometry
  consumer states, and the suppress covers only what its comment claims. A
  project with no wing surface is unaffected — that is `None`, not a refusal,
  and STRSPEED's typed `wing_area_sqft` fallback stays live.

- **One module with an invalid input no longer takes a whole results page down
  (#145, tier M, 2026-08-29).** `run_all_modules` lets a plain `ValueError`
  propagate on purpose (M2R-8): an invalid domain input and an absent one are
  different answers, and the invalid one must not vanish. Right for the CLI and
  the export, which should fail the run — but the Results Review and Export
  *pages* render every module's results and died whole on the first bad slice,
  showing a traceback instead of the twenty modules that were fine. Three of the
  seven bundled examples carry an aileron or flap slice with no area, so both
  pages were dead on all three, reachable by opening a shipped example.
  `registry.run_all_modules_reporting` returns the failures beside the results
  instead, and both pages name the offending module and what is wrong with it.
  `MissingInputError` is still simply skipped, and `run_all_modules` itself is
  unchanged — the CLI still fails the run, as m2 requires.

- **An Optional record block in the oracle GUI is created and removed by name,
  never attached by a stray touch (#143, tier M, 2026-08-29).**
  One interaction with any widget in an Optional record's block used to attach
  the whole record: ticking the LANDING coefficient set's flaps-down flag on the
  Aerodynamic Data page attached a zero-coefficient set, `refresh_derived` →
  `AeroCoefficientsInput.normalize()` filled its `stall_cl` from `clmax_flap` so
  it passed the #81 guard, un-checking did not detach it, and the phantom set
  saved into the `.project.json` — taking Flight Envelope and SELECT down with a
  400-iteration solver failure (#144). Every Optional record block now takes the
  list-row posture (#88/#72): its fields are off the page behind an `➕ Add …`
  button, with a caption naming the fields that are missing, and a `🗑 Remove …`
  control behind an expander takes the record away again with everything entered
  in it. Which blocks these are is read from the field registry
  (`oracle_app.form.optional_steps`), so a new Optional slice carries the posture
  the moment the registry classifies it; a plain page visit still attaches
  nothing (OG-F), and a list record keeps its own gesture, the row counter.

- **A `null` in a project file is refused by name instead of crashing a widget
  three modules later (#121, tier M, 2026-08-29).** `sloads.io` coerced numeric
  *containers* (#76) and said in its own comment that scalars were out of scope,
  so a scalar `null` went straight through into whatever field it named:
  `"full_down_aileron_deg": null` landed on a field declared `float = 0.0`, the
  file loaded clean, and the main GUI's Flight Envelope page died on
  `float(None)` — a raw `TypeError` out of an `st.number_input`, on a page the
  user had only opened. The loader now refuses a `null` where the field's own
  annotation does not admit one (`io._reject_nulls`, called by `_filtered` and
  at the head of the ten readers that name their fields explicitly), with a
  message naming the record and the key to fix. An `Optional` field keeps its
  `null` — "not entered" (`SurfaceInput.front_spar_pct`) and "not stated"
  (the gear `carrier`) are answers, not accidents. It is refused rather than
  read as the field's default: which of the two the author meant is not
  recoverable from the file, and defaulting is the silent zeroing the LIMNZ
  derive refuses for the same reason (#122) — `fuselage_mass.stations_are_override`
  was doing exactly that, `bool(None)` → `False`, and is now refused with the
  rest. No shipped example changes: every `null` in all seven is on an `Optional`
  field, and no model field defaults to `None` under a non-`Optional`
  annotation, so no project this app writes can trip the new refusal.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-08-28

### Added

- **One derive-by-default override mechanism for the duplicated inputs (design
  note 36 OV-1…OV-12, tier L, 2026-08-27, #97).** Eight C210 findings, one
  contract: a blank collapsed field **falsy-derives** through one named
  resolver per quantity — the `select.py` `value or derive(project)` idiom
  generalized — and a typed value overrides. Blank now derives: WTENV
  `gross_weight` ← the MTOW SSOT (C210-13); `taper_ratio` ← the paired
  planform's tip/centreline chord and `tip_ratio` ← the new
  `SurfaceInput.tip_cap_width_in` / semi-span (C210-31 — a blank taper no
  longer lands on the TAU fit's pointed-wing knot, τ = 0.206209, silently);
  the h-tail's `aspect_ratio_wing` ← the consolidated planform-AR owner
  (`derived_geometry.planform_aspect_ratio`, OV-5 — the unguarded downwash
  divide dies) and `wing_lift_slope_per_rad` ← the cruise set's C1 × 57.3
  (C210-36); SELECT's `full_down_aileron_deg` ← the aileron's own travel
  (C210-38); flap NG ← the envelope's own GUST VF corner factor,
  `flight_envelope.gust_at_vf`, bit-for-bit (C210-39, owner directive); engine
  LIMNZ ← the 23.337 limit, and — with the new `engine_mass_item`/
  `prop_mass_item` row selectors — engine/prop weight and CG ← the named
  weight-database row, every engine consumer reading through one resolver
  (C210-41, owner directive); an empty `aero.surfaces` seeds a schema-default
  row per unpaired symmetric planform (C210-29 seed half — the four fixtures
  with unpaired tails gain their htail/vtail spanwise views; only the
  `airloads` digests moved, every other channel byte-identical). The per-set
  stall CLs register their existing `normalize()` fill-through (C210-15
  ruling). Registry mechanics (OV-9/OV-11): every collapsed path carries
  `derived_from` + a resolver in `EXTERNAL_VALUES`
  (`field_registry.COLLAPSED_OVERRIDES`), the oracle GUI shows the derived
  value beside each field blank or typed and warns on a > 1e-9 typed
  disagreement, and the OV-11 drift guard fails CI on a future duplicated
  input without its link. New warnings `aileron_deflection_mismatch` /
  `engine_mass_row_mismatch`; a mass selector naming no row is refused by
  name. Schema **55 → 56** (additive; identity hop, v55 files load unchanged).
  Gates G-OV-1…G-OV-6 in `tests/test_derive_override.py`; the full Appendix A
  oracle and twin-closure suites pass untouched.

- **The oracle GUI user guide ships (design note 34, #96, tier M,
  2026-08-27).** A new docs section `docs/60_guide/`: front matter (index,
  getting started, before-you-start checklist, conventions with the one
  LIMIT-vs-ULTIMATE statement — UG-8), one chapter per oracle page in
  `sloads.workflow.oracle_steps()` order with the eight-section note-34
  template, and four appendices (the `ga6_normal` Appendix A pass with
  page-cited checkpoints, the `baron_58` SI pass closing on the unit channel
  — UG-12, troubleshooting, where-next). Per-page **field tables and the
  chapter list are generated** from `sloads/field_registry.py` by
  `docs/generate_data_dict.py` into `60_guide/_generated/` (UG-3/UG-7 —
  adding a `.BAS`-backed step scaffolds its chapter with no hand edit);
  screenshots come from the re-runnable Playwright script
  `scripts/capture_guide_shots.py` (UG-4; `playwright` joins the dev extra).
  The worked twin is new: **`examples/baron_58.project.json`** (UG-9), a
  Beech Baron 58 / two IO-550-C built from FAA Aircraft Spec 3A16 with every
  estimate marked in `examples/baron_58.sources.md`, running all fourteen
  oracle pages warning-free — including ONENGOUT — with D-25 entered ground
  loadings, and declared `EXACT` under the oracle-reduction gate. Acceptance
  gates **G-UG-1…G-UG-6** (`tests/test_guide.py`) landed before any chapter:
  chapter↔step bijection, generated-tree exactness, image↔reference
  closure with alt text, both examples running every module they reach,
  link resolution, and the template-heading order. `10_standard/GUI_USER_GUIDE.md`
  is not superseded (UG-2) — the two guides now cross-link. Filed en route:
  #121 (main-GUI `float(None)` crash on the blank SELECT aileron field) and
  #122 (the OV-7 derive chain escaping as a raw traceback on a half-entered
  planform).

- **A Tools section in the sidebar of both GUIs** (#80, C210 build review
  2026-08-23, tier M). Two conversions the C210 build did by hand at the
  envelope and speeds pages: an **airspeed converter** — a speed in any of
  KCAS/KEAS/KTAS plus a pressure altitude, all three out, ISA-only and subsonic
  — and a **% MAC ↔ fuselage station** converter, in both directions. The
  arithmetic is the existing `sloads` owners' (`convert_airspeed` /
  `eas_from_airspeed`; `mac_reference` and the two %MAC functions), so a Tool
  cannot answer a question differently from a page. It lives in the shared
  `app_shell` sidebar, one implementation for both front-ends, and is
  display-only: it reads the project and writes nothing back — the ground of
  the owner's refinement to the oracle GUI's capability cap, which governs
  analysis and data capability, not inert display utilities.
- **KCAS in, not only KEAS out** (#80, tier S). `convert_airspeed` converted
  *from* equivalent airspeed only, so a converter that took KEAS alone would
  have left the conversion actually wanted — a POH or placard speed, which is
  calibrated airspeed — still to be done by hand. `eas_from_airspeed` inverts
  the same relation in closed form, exactly: the round trip is pinned to 1e-9
  at five altitudes for all three measures.
- **The %MAC tool says which wing it measured from** (#80, C210-13). WTENV
  falls back to the wing planform when the weight envelope's XLEMAC/MAC pair is
  left blank, and nothing on that page says so. A tool that quietly answered
  with the fallback would have carried the same silence into the sidebar, so it
  names the reference and prints the XLEMAC and MAC it used.

### Changed

- **The git workflow is explicitly required in `CLAUDE.md` (tier S, 2026-08-27).**
  Two Required-practices bullets now state that no development work lands outside
  the git workflow — the solo profile (`DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0,
  `solo_start.sh`/`solo_close.sh`) is the operative mode — and that every git/`gh`
  command (the solo scripts included) is presented to the user **one at a time**,
  waiting for the pasted output before the next. With it: the status-prose trims
  (mission dates, "all 22 ported", header decorations) that CLAUDE.md's own
  rules-and-pointers rule asks for, and the `00_INDEX.md` row for design note 37.

- **Design note 37 filed at AGREED and the 0.8.0 band extended (tier S, 2026-08-27).**
  The landing load-factor note (`docs/30_future/37_landing_load_factor_note.md`,
  LF-1…LF-12, G-LF-1…G-LF-6) is AGREED (owner, in session) and its implementation
  is #123, pulled into band B ahead of the cut under the 2026-08-24 first-order
  ruling; the note's §4 sweep filed one adjacent finding, the twice-written
  max-continuous-HP precedence (#124), beside it. Band B is no longer
  ready-to-cut — it cuts when empty.

- **The six bundled examples are re-stamped at the current schema (#93, tier L, 2026-08-25).**
  They had sat at v41 for fourteen versions, so every example load ran hops 43, 46 and 54 in
  memory — the repo's own fixtures were the only prior-schema files in existence. Regenerated
  through the chain before it was deleted, and verified output-neutral two ways: the `Project`
  loaded from each old file and from its replacement are identical dicts, and
  `tests/fixtures_imperial/digests.json` did not move. New guard
  `test_schema_guards.py::test_every_bundled_example_is_written_at_the_current_version` reads
  the stamp off **disk**, so the next `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump fails CI until the examples are
  re-stamped with it.

- **What this release is has one owner, and the trove classifier moves to
  `4 - Beta` (tier S, 2026-08-28; production-release review §3.5, owner ruling
  §5.3).** The maturity claim is genuinely mixed — the FAR23 core is
  oracle-locked and the oracle GUI is the finished deliverable, while `app/` and
  the concept-mode features are not — and PyPI's `Development Status` takes one
  value from a fixed vocabulary. So `pyproject.toml` carries the value a *fresh
  installer* is owed (`4 - Beta`: the distribution ships both front-ends and one
  of them is beta), and the sentence the classifier cannot hold gets a single
  owner, `app_shell.components.RELEASE_STATE`: *"Core analysis developed per
  FAR 23 LOADS and the oracle GUI production-ready; additional features and the
  full sloads GUI in beta."* `README.md` and `CAPABILITIES.md` carry it verbatim
  and both GUIs' About panel consumes the symbol — so a person typing an
  airplane into the beta front-end is told so where they are, rather than in
  packaging metadata `pip` reads and they do not. Markdown cannot import a
  constant, so "one owner" is enforced the only way prose allows
  (`tests/test_doc_currency.py`, two halves, both verified to fail on a
  mutation): the documents must contain the owner's string verbatim and the
  About panel must consume the symbol, and **no second spelling** of it may
  appear anywhere else in the tree. Same posture as `LANDING_L_FAR_CAPTION`,
  one level up — a statement about the product rather than about a widget.

- **TAILDIST states the aero state of each case it distributes (note 35, #100,
  tier L, 2026-08-27; C210-32).** Every h-tail/v-tail `CriticalCondition` now
  publishes the state its method actually used — `alpha_tail_deg` (AT / fin
  AoA), `delta_deg` (elevator TE-dn + / rudder SC-2 TE-port +) and `q_psf` —
  as additive `None`-default result fields beside L-7's `beta_deg` (AS-1/AS-2;
  no migration hop, `SCHEMA_VERSION` unchanged), and TAILDIST prints them
  ahead of each condition's stations with the carried-across fields on
  `TailChordResult`. A quantity the method never defines states its fixed
  reason instead of a guess (AS-4): the checked-maneuver δ (the 23.423(b)
  increment is the pitching-acceleration inertia term), the side-gust q
  (23.443(b) is linear in V), any h-tail β; a persisted critical set that
  predates the fields says "re-run SELECT". The AHT / AVT + EFFECTV
  intermediates print **once per component** from the same single-source
  owners inside the loads — the finite-surface slope `2π/(1+2/AR)` is
  consolidated to `_vtail.lift_curve_slope` (AS-5), replacing three inline
  spellings in `select.py`, with a one-spelling drift guard. Closure gates
  G-AS-1..G-AS-5 in `tests/test_taildist_aero_state.py`: the Appendix A
  case-202 δ −5.39° oracle, the rel-1e-9 identities reconstructing every
  fixture's stamped `LT25`/`LT50` from the published state, the
  no-silent-blank statement guard, the stale-set statement and the §1
  per-label literals. **No load number moves** (AS-8): only the
  `csv/taildist` and `txt/taildist` digests changed.

- **The weight estimate now says what reads it, and shows the gap** (C210-9, issue #78,
  tier M, 2026-08-26). WTESTIMA sits at the top of the oracle Weight & Mass page above
  WTONECG and WTENV, and nothing on the page said that neither of them reads it: the mass
  properties every downstream program uses come from the itemized data base the user
  enters. The block is captioned with that (`weight_estimate.ADVISORY`) and the estimate's
  empty weight and max take-off weight are shown beside the entered figures with the delta
  (`compare_with_itemized`) — on the Cessna 210 that is +22 % on empty weight, ordinary
  scatter for a GA statistical correlation and, until now, a gap nothing framed. Both
  entered figures come from their owners rather than being re-summed: the empty weight from
  `WeightInput.database_totals`, MTOW from `cg_cases.max_takeoff_weight` (G-14) — **not**
  the database's first element, which holds full fuel and full payload at once and is
  documented as a ceiling. The comparison is shown plainly and never thresholded: there is
  no sourced figure for "too far", and inventing one would put a verdict on the page where
  the finding asked only for the two numbers side by side.
- **`PROGRAM_SPEC` said the estimate feeds the two programs under it** (C210-9, #78,
  tier M, 2026-08-26). The WTESTIMA section stated "feeds WTONECG *and* WTENV — parallel
  siblings off WTESTIMA", which is the suite's data flow (UG Table 2.2) and runs **through
  the weight data base**. Here that base is authored by the user, so the estimate reaches
  it only when the seed button copies it there; absent that click nothing reads the
  estimate at all. Both halves are now stated, so the caption and the spec cannot be read
  against each other.

### Fixed

- **The 0.8.0 band has its closure order, and `backlog_issues.py create` can
  no longer duplicate the table (tier S, 2026-08-26).** The 2026-08-26 re-cut
  (owner, in session) orders band B by fix dependency — #99, then #97 (the
  collapsed-override mechanism #95 consumes), #98, #95, #100's implementation,
  #94 (text last, against shipped mechanisms), #96 last so the guide captures
  finished pages — with #100's design note drafted first (rule 1); the table is
  renumbered densely; **#92 is ruled (b)**, re-aimed at CI's coverage leg (the
  local command already passes the clause's own thresholds); and the wing-fuel
  row, which had never had an issue behind its old "7a" ordinal, is filed as
  **#111** (milestone 1.0.0). The filing exposed that
  `.github/backlog_issue_map.json` still held only the original 20-issue
  migration keyed by pre-rewrite titles, so `create` re-opened the whole table
  as #101–#120: the 19 duplicates are closed with cross-references, the map is
  rebuilt keying every current row title to its real issue number, and
  `scripts/backlog_issues.py check` runs clean both ways.

- **The priority table re-cut for the 0.7.2 cut; band B is the milestone in
  flight (tier S, 2026-08-25).** `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §4's post-cut step — the
  backlog reflects what the release closed — had not run for 0.7.2: §Where
  things stand still read "0.7.2 is content-complete and **uncut**" and the
  empty band-A header row was still in the table, a day after `v0.7.2` was
  tagged. Both corrected: the narrative states the cut (schema v55 unchanged,
  defect-only, #88 and the narrow half of #71 named beside the seven carried
  `b`'s), band A is retired with the release it named, and the cut signal for
  the milestone in flight is stated where the old one was — **cut 0.8.0 when
  band B is empty**. No row content changed; the 2026-08-24 re-cut's ordering
  and rulings stand as written.

- **The branch-protection guard reaches the review settings, and three promises
  `main` never kept are corrected (CR-D-4's class, tier S, 2026-08-26).** The
  guard added with #46 tracked `required_pull_request`, which is true the moment
  GitHub carries *any* review block for the branch — so `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md`
  §2 could promise "one approving review from someone other than the author",
  "review from Code Owners required" and "stale approvals dismissed on push"
  against a block that required none of the three, and no hop-1 assertion could
  see it. The snapshot now tracks `required_approving_review_count`,
  `required_code_owner_reviews`, `dismiss_stale_reviews` and
  `required_conversation_resolution`, and the first `--check` run against live
  `main` found exactly that drift: all three off, conversation resolution the
  only one live.
- **The prose is corrected, not the branch — the settings split by profile.**
  The three review requirements are the multi-dev profile's target and are off
  under §0's solo profile deliberately: GitHub does not let an author approve
  their own pull request, and `.github/CODEOWNERS` names one person on every
  line, so either setting would block **every** merge — the milestone PR
  included — until a second collaborator exists. Turning them on joins restoring
  squash-merge in the switch-over list. §2 now states both profiles, as it
  already did for the merge method, and
  `test_the_process_docs_agree_with_the_live_review_settings` holds the prose to
  whichever way the settings are set, in both directions: the "OFF under §0"
  bullet is required while they are off and must go when they come on.

- **The C210 review's text-only residue lands: eleven helps and captions now say
  what the mechanisms do (#94, tier S, 2026-08-27).** The EMPTY-only item sum is
  labelled **empty weight** everywhere it shows (the ordering chain, the fleet
  comparison; OEW adds the MINIMUM crew — C210-12); `role` help states it assigns
  the LANDLOAD slot and validates nothing (C210-14); the chosen speeds state
  "blank = computed minimum, below-minimum values are raised", with `chosen_vf`
  distinguished from the placard VFE (C210-16, the MFC half moot since #79);
  `xtc`/`xtf` carry the CP convention (flaps up ≈ 5 % tail MAC, flaps down ≈ 25 %)
  **plus a computed suggestion from the empennage record** beside the fields in
  both GUIs (`derived_geometry.tail_cp_suggestion`; `oracle_app.form.GROUP_NOTES`),
  `mn` and the altitudes say what they are (C210-20); the SELECT block states its
  search scope — the governing case over the full V-n matrix, all loadings, CGs
  and altitudes (C210-26); `section_slope` says it is the 2-D section slope, not
  the AR-reduced C1 (C210-28); `wing_mass.cases` states "0 rows = the SELECT
  governing set; typed rows REPLACE it entirely" (C210-30); the oracle Tail Loads
  page points at the spanwise deliverable's home (main GUI Tail Span Loads + the
  export decks — C210-33); `ref_waterline` is captioned reserved/not consumed
  (C210-34, owner ruling); blank Optional number inputs carry an "empty — type a
  value" placeholder so Streamlit's inert steppers stop reading as a locked
  widget (C210-42, the #35 blank-render contract unchanged); and the sidebar says
  before the click that **Save to disk** writes `projects/<name>.project.json`
  beside the app while **Download** lets the browser choose the location
  (C210-48). Guards in `tests/test_oracle_gui.py` (`GROUP_NOTES` keys must name a
  rendered group; the suggestion arithmetic; the placeholder; the two advisories).

- **An Optional override entered in the oracle GUI could never be taken back**
  (PB-20, issue #72, tier M, 2026-08-25). Once `landing.gear_load_factor`,
  `speeds.chosen_vc/vd`, `aero.surfaces[].tau` or `weight.envelope.mac` held a
  number, nothing in this GUI could return the field to "computed" — and it is
  the only editor its projects have, so a value typed to see what it did was
  permanent. The review's proposed fix (write `None` when the widget comes back
  empty) cannot work: a number-seeded `st.number_input` never comes back empty,
  because the frontend restores the last value and the serde reads an empty
  submission as the seed. A filled Optional field now carries a **✕ clear**
  button — a deliberate named click, the posture row deletion already takes —
  which empties the widget through the one door Streamlit offers, its own state,
  from the `on_click` callback that is the only legal moment to write it. The
  next render reads the empty widget and unfills the field on its normal persist
  path, so there is still exactly one writer. Required fields offer no clear
  (`None` is not one of their values) and neither do the display-only copies of
  a quantity someone else owns.
- **The confirmation for the one action that writes outside the session was
  never seen** (PB-23, #72, tier S, 2026-08-25). Save-to-disk emitted
  `st.success` and then `st.rerun()`, which discards the frame that carried it.
  It is a toast now — the channel the loader's repair warnings already use
  because it survives the rerun.
- **A table row could only be deleted from the end** (PB-23, #72, tier M,
  2026-08-25). The row counter plus #88's surplus button meant removing item 3
  of 24 cost twenty-one deletions and twenty retypes. Rows are now deleted where
  they sit: a button inside each row's expander where rows carry a polyline, a
  by-name picker beneath the grid where they do not, both naming the row that
  goes. The deletion re-sizes the counter with it — left where it was, the next
  render grows the list back up to the retained count and the deleted row
  reappears as a blank, which is the #88 data-loss defect wearing the other sign.
- **Clearing a required table cell put the old value back in silence** (PB-23,
  #72, tier S, 2026-08-25). Restoring it is correct — a required field has no
  `None` — but with nothing said, the grid read as having eaten the edit. The
  columns that refused are now named beneath the table, beside the existing rule
  for a row with an empty cell.

- **The non-owner mark reaches composite fields, and an empty result block no longer
  crashes the page (#89, code review 2026-08-24 §4.3, tier S, 2026-08-25).**
  `_copy_note` was reachable from `render_scalar` alone, so the first non-owner tuple,
  curve or enum set would have rendered bare and silently editable — the #36/CR-A-2
  defect returning through a door never closed. Marking the external owners walked
  straight through it: `engines[].engine_cg` is a three-member tuple copied from the
  weight database. `render_field` now forwards the project to every branch and the
  composite renderers caption; a display-only composite would need a mark the renderer
  cannot give, so the registry may no longer hold one. Separately,
  `st.columns(len(block.artifacts))` is guarded for the empty case, which would have
  taken down any results page carrying a table and no download.

- **The deprecated `use_container_width` is gone from both front-ends, and the
  Streamlit requirement now states both a floor and a ceiling policy (#129,
  tier S, 2026-08-28; production-release review §3.7, owner ruling §5.4).**
  73 call sites migrated to `width="stretch"` — 62 in `app/views/`, 11 in
  `app_shell/` (`sidebar.py` ×7, `project_state.py` ×4) — taken **whole**
  rather than by GUI, because upstream documents the parameter as *"deprecated
  and will be removed in a future release"* and the release that removes it
  breaks Open / Save / Download / Build-results-zip in *both* GUIs at once, on
  a fresh install, with no version constraint to stop it. The migration also
  closed the mirror-image gap: four `width="stretch"` sites had already shipped
  against a `streamlit` floor set years earlier for `st.navigation(expanded=…)`,
  so a resolver honouring the declared floor would have raised on an unexpected
  keyword. The floor now names the API the code actually calls — `width=`
  arrived per element upstream (buttons, then `st.dataframe`/`st.data_editor`,
  then `st.plotly_chart`), and the last of those is the binding one. **No upper
  bound, stated as a decision rather than left as an omission**
  (`pyproject.toml`, `00_program_overview.md` §Dependency requirements): CI
  installs the runtime set unpinned on every run, so an upstream removal fails
  the GUI tests here before it reaches an installed user. Three guards
  (practice 3): no front-end file may pass `use_container_width` (AST-derived
  over every GUI package plus the shell, so a third front-end is covered the
  day it lands); the declared floor must admit the layout parameter the
  front-ends pass; and CI's install must stay unpinned and unconstrained, since
  the ceiling policy rests on it. Each verified by mutation — reinstating the
  old spelling, lowering the floor, and constraining the CI install each fail
  their own guard. No behaviour change: `width="stretch"` is the documented
  equivalent of `use_container_width=True`.

- **A design note can no longer claim work is unbuilt after it has shipped
  (#128, tier S, 2026-08-28; production-release review §3.3).** Two notes still
  carried their pre-build status: [note 32](docs/30_future/32_oracle_gui_note.md)
  said *"everything else is unbuilt"* of the oracle GUI whose every §7 step is
  marked shipped in its own table (OG-A…OG-C2 on 2026-08-19, OG-D…OG-F on
  2026-08-20), and [note 35](docs/30_future/35_taildist_aero_state_note.md) said
  *"Nothing below is built yet"* of work that shipped as #100 on 2026-08-27.
  Both now state what shipped, in the shape notes 36/37 (`SHIPPED`) and 34
  (`AGREED …; BUILT …`) already use. This blocks a cut rather than trailing it:
  `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §4 step 3 rolls the notes into `docs/40_history/` at the
  cut, so an "unbuilt" claim would enter the permanent record of the release
  that built it. The structural half (practice 3) is a guard in
  `tests/test_doc_currency.py`: a note carrying an unbuilt claim while also
  carrying shipped evidence fails. The evidence is deliberately **in-repo** —
  whether an issue is closed lives on GitHub, which CI has no credential to
  read, but a closed item leaves a `changes/` fragment citing its note by the
  tiered-closure rule, and that fragment exists *because* something closed. A
  companion test asserts the pattern still matches the two sentences it was
  written for, so it cannot quietly decay into a guard that passes by seeing
  nothing. Verified: reintroducing either sentence fails its note's case.

- **A widget that flips disabled is pinned to its governing value (tier S,
  2026-08-27; the #95 CI find on 0b38c8a).** A display-only number widget kept
  its stale live state when its owner appeared mid-session — type a fuselage
  length, add the outline on the same page, and the disabled field went on
  showing the typed number while the analysis read the outline's own length
  (current Streamlit lets keyed widget state outvote `value=`; the G5 journey
  caught it on CI's newer Streamlit, not the pinned local one).
  `app_shell.components._seeded_number` now writes the governing seed into a
  **disabled** widget's session state before instantiation — one point on the
  unit boundary, so every disabled scalar in both GUIs shows the number the
  calc uses. Guard:
  `tests/test_oracle_gui.py::test_a_widget_that_flips_disabled_is_pinned_to_the_governing_value`
  walks the exact live→disabled flip.

- **A documented git or CI setting can no longer differ from the live one in
  silence (CR-D-4…D-8, CR-D-11, issue #46, tier S, 2026-08-25).** Six doc/CI
  conformance findings from the 2026-08-20 critical review, closed together
  because they are one class: a rule stated in prose, with nothing comparing it
  to the thing it describes.
- **The CI matrix is asymmetric, and now says so everywhere it is described.**
  `ci.yml` runs 3.12 alone on every pull request and every `dev/**` push; the
  3.9 / 3.11 legs, `sbeam-roundtrip (3.11)` and the coverage-instrumented leg
  run only on the push to `main`, so **a change that breaks 3.9 merges green by
  design**. `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` and `00_program_overview.md` (§Testing and
  §Coverage floor) all stated the full matrix with no caveat. Worse,
  `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §2 listed six required status checks, three of which
  a pull request never produces — a required check that never reports blocks its
  PR forever — while §0's table on the same page named the correct three.
  Corrected to the live fast gate, with the reason the other three cannot be
  required.
- **Two new guards make it structural, in two hops** (`tests/test_ci_conformance.py`,
  `.github/branch-protection.json`, `scripts/branch_protection_snapshot.py`).
  Hop 1 always runs and needs no network: every required check in the snapshot
  must be one `ci.yml` actually reports on a PR; the process docs must name that
  set; and no doc may assert "merge commits allowed", "linear history off" or
  `git merge main` outside a quotation or a retraction — the wording that made
  the 0.7.2 milestone PR unmergeable at the cut. Hop 2 is
  `branch_protection_snapshot.py --check`, which reads GitHub and is run by the
  owner (added to the `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §3.1 checklist). The split is
  deliberate: CI has no `gh` credential, and a gate that needs a credential CI
  lacks is a gate that silently skips — which is the defect class being closed.
- **The nav guard cuts both ways, and the user guide's phase table is derived.**
  `test_every_view_file_is_a_workflow_step` closes CR-D-8: a stray
  `app/views/foo.py` never entered nav, still passed the smoke suite, and no
  guard failed — a page could exist, be tested, and be unreachable forever.
  `GUI_USER_GUIDE.md` §2's phase table is now asserted against `workflow.py`
  (CR-D-7) and was wrong in two places: Aircraft Comparison was filed under
  Load-case plotting where the graph puts it in Export, and the Flight-loads row
  omitted **Tail Span Loads** and **Balanced Cases** — the two pages carrying the
  mission's primary distributed deliverable.
- **`pyproject.toml` owns every version floor; the overview names none** (CR-D-5).
  It had carried a `streamlit` floor six minor versions below the real one, which
  exists because of `st.navigation(expanded=…)`. `test_doc_currency.py` gains a
  volatile pattern for a version specifier beside a dependency name, so the class
  is visible to the guard that was already meant to catch it.
- **`cspell.json` is an editor convenience, and the prose rule that pretended
  otherwise is gone** (CR-D-11). "New domain terms → `cspell.json`" was a
  convention with no gate — the shape rule 3 forbids. Given the choice between
  adding a gate and dropping the rule, the rule went.
- **The suite-runtime clause stops asserting a number it cannot hold** (CR-D-6).
  §Testing claimed "the suite in the tens of seconds and no test over ten"
  against a measured parallel suite several times that, with its own revisit
  thresholds crossed and nothing filed. It now points at `--durations` output,
  and the work the clause asks for — splitting the whole-pipeline-per-assertion
  tests — is filed as its own backlog row rather than left as a standing claim.
- **`backlog_issues.py check` compares a row's band with its issue's milestone.**
  The second instance of the same class, found the same day: #71 sat open on the
  already-cut **0.7.1** while its row was in the 0.8.0 band, and no gate saw it —
  the check proved row ↔ open-issue correspondence both ways but never requested
  `milestone`. It now does, and the expected milestone is read from **the band
  header's own text** rather than a hardcoded letter map, because the letters
  move at every re-cut: band A retired when 0.7.2 was cut, making B the milestone
  in flight. An issue parked on a milestone `CHANGELOG.md` shows as already cut
  is reported too, since every cut milestone in this repository is still `open`
  on GitHub and that state carries no information.
- **Two parser defects found building that check, both pinned by tests.**
  `BAND_ROW` matched a single letter (`^\|\s*\*\*([A-Z])\s+`), so the **B2**
  header added by the 2026-08-24 re-cut never matched and every 0.9.0 row
  inherited `band:B` — the 0.8.0 label. The band is exactly what the new
  milestone check compares, so it could not have worked. And a row's issue was
  read from the whole table line, so the "(#29)" that band D's function-size row
  cites in its *What ships* cell was taken as that row's identity, putting the
  single band-B2 row under band D: a guard reporting a fault against the row it
  had misread. `row_ref` now reads the **Item** cell alone.

- **The geometry-page presentation family, and one summary-table shape per
  module (tier M, 2026-08-27, #95; C210-1/2/3/5/6/8/22/25/26/27).** The
  C210 build's placement/duplication findings closed as mechanisms, not
  patches. **Tables (owner directive, "one line per case"):**
  `report.summary_rows` is now the one dispatch every summary channel renders
  through — the module CSV (`io.load_cases_csv`), the oracle results page and
  the main GUI's Results Review — so the screen and the CSV are the same rows
  by construction. SELECT renders one row per condition with its per-case SF
  (`report.critical_rows`, sharing `governing_loads_table`'s one-line core;
  the oracle page groups the rows per component), replacing the stacked
  ~150-row shape whose SF column was blank on every wing case; WTENV renders
  one row per (weight, station) point (`report.weight_station_rows` — the
  envelope vertices, CG-limit corners and summary weights fold from stacked
  pairs); every other non-load-case module gets the data-shaped floor
  (`results_to_rows` drops all-empty columns). **Accepted deliverable-format
  change: the frozen Imperial `csv/*` digests moved with it — every other
  channel (text, sbeam decks, case index, gear report) is byte-identical.**
  **Derives (the #97 mechanism, extended):** a blank elevator/rudder area
  derives as the sum of its own hinge halves (`select.derived_elevator_area` /
  `derived_rudder_area`; a >1 % typed disagreement warns,
  `elevator_area_mismatch`/`rudder_area_mismatch` — Appendix A's own rounding
  sits at 0.2–0.7 % and stays silent) and a blank v-tail `wing_span_in` from
  the WINGGEOM planform's own span (`select.effective_vtail_inputs`; ONENGOUT
  and the tail-span control split read through it, rule 4). The undisclosed
  fallbacks are disclosed: `wing_weight_lb`'s 0 → 0.09·MTOW and the side-gust
  rod IZZ (`select.default_side_gust_izz`) render beside their fields, and the
  SELECT block captions both rod inertias against WTONECG's database values
  (C210-25: +34 %/+49 % on the C210). **Placement:**
  `field_registry.DISPLAY_GROUPS` renders a field on the page its *quantity*
  belongs to — the h-tail record's wing-aero fields (ARW, AW, the IW angles)
  with the aero data, SELECT's section cm with the aero data, the aileron
  travel with the aileron record, the wing weight with the weight data.
  **Geometry:** the parametric wing seeds from a typed `wing` planform behind
  a button (`configuration.parametric_wing_seed` via
  `field_registry.RECORD_SEEDS` — GR-GEOM-3, seeded and overridable), and
  `fuselage_length` renders disabled exactly while the outline it summarises
  exists. New CONVENTIONS §7 SSOT row; guards in
  `tests/test_summary_shapes.py` and the extended registry/select/validation
  suites.

- **A grid cell typed and confirmed with Enter was still discarded** (C210-4 residual,
  issue #77, tier S, 2026-08-25). Streamlit's `st.data_editor` keeps the cell editor
  **open** on Enter — the value is on screen but not in the frame the widget returns —
  and the next Tab or click closes the editor by throwing it away. Reproduced in a bare
  Streamlit 1.58.0 app during the Cessna 210 build, so it is the grid's behaviour and
  there is no version of `form.py` that fixes it: every oracle page that renders a grid
  now says **"commit a grid cell with Tab, not Enter"**, above the first one.
  The sentence is owned by `app_shell.components.GRID_COMMIT_NOTE` rather than by the
  GUI that says it today, because fourteen of the sixteen `st.data_editor` call sites
  are in `app/views/`, whose layout is frozen pending #29 — that page set adopts the
  note by importing it, not by retyping a sentence that would then drift.
- **The warning had been withdrawn for a defect it did not cover** (#77, tier S,
  2026-08-25). Enter dropping an entry was *also* a symptom of C210-4, the remount race
  that was ours, and when `_stable_frame` closed that race on 2026-08-23 the Enter
  warning went out with it — the two presented identically as "Enter loses my entry"
  and only one of them was fixed. The guard is therefore two-sided: a page that renders
  a grid must say it *and* a page that does not must stay silent, so the note and the
  grids cannot part company again.
- **The loader half of #77 was already closed.** "The loader coerces or refuses a
  non-numeric corner, under a guard" (C210-7 residual) shipped on 2026-08-24 as #76 —
  `io._numeric_shape` reading the numeric containers off the model's own annotations,
  swept across all 18 of them. Recorded here because the issue asked for both halves.
- **The geometry-presentation family had been recorded under this issue's number**
  (#77/#95, tier S, 2026-08-25). Backlog row 20, the 2026-08-24 code review's
  existing-rows list and the completed-development history all pointed the C210
  geometry family at `#77`, which is this grid defect — and the geometry family had
  no issue at all, while `#77` appeared in no planning document. Found by reading the
  issue before working the row. Filed as **#95** with a body (rule 5) and the backlog
  corrected; the two reviews and the history keep what they said, as dated records,
  and row 20 says how to read them.

- **The landing load factor is entered as N, not NLG — the wing lift factor moves the gear
  reaction again (note 37, #123, tier L, schema v57, 2026-08-27).** `LandingInput.gear_load_factor`
  (an NLG override with a `0.0` sentinel) is replaced by the optional governing
  `airplane_load_factor` N; `NLG = N − L` is derived by the one owner
  `landing.governing_load_factors` and never entered. The old override made `L` inert on the
  vertical reaction (`VMP = ½·NLG·W·AP/DP` read NLG and nothing else) while the page reported
  the energy-derived N the reactions were *not* computed from. The 56→57 hop is semantic
  (`N = NLG_old + L`) and reproduces every NLG the reaction path read — no load number moves;
  the only moved fleet numbers are the three concept fixtures deliberately nudged to
  `N = 2.67` (LF-10, +0.15 % on NLG, clearing the 23.473(g) floor). `ga6_normal` and
  `cessna_210` now carry the manual's rounded design point as an explicit `N = 3.167`. The
  `L ≤ 0.667` cap is removed (FAR 25.473(a)(2) permits 1.0; both GUIs caption the FAR defaults
  as guidance via one shared string); `N ≤ L` is refused by name; the 23.473(g) floors
  (`N ≥ 2.67`, `NLG ≥ 2.0`, one policy owner `landing.far23_473g_floor_violations`) **block**
  in a FAR 23 category and **warn** in concept. Both GUIs seed N from the computed energy
  value with a way back to computed, render NLG as a derived output, and caution when the
  entered N sits below the energy value (`cessna_210` trips it: 3.1670 vs 3.3885). The
  LGFACTOR condition now reports the governing pair beside the oracle-locked energy rows, so
  the landing deliverable channels and the three concept examples' balance/deck digests are
  deliberately regenerated.

- **The %MAC ↔ fuselage-station Tool no longer reinterprets its entered station
  on a unit switch (#126, tier S, 2026-08-28; production-release review §3.4).**
  The station field was the one converted number input in either GUI spelled by
  hand instead of through `app_shell.components.unit_number_input`: seeded with a
  converted length but keyed without the system suffix `number_input_name`
  appends on the converted path, so Streamlit's retained state outvoted `value=`
  and the same digits were read as inches on one render and as millimetres on
  the next — on `ga6_normal`, 63.641 answered **0.00 % MAC** in Imperial and
  **−88.29 % MAC** after toggling to SI, the same field, the same number, two
  answers. It now goes through the one unit boundary like every other converted
  number, so a switch re-seeds the field with the leading edge in the new unit.
  Display-only, so nothing was stored and no load moved. Two behavioural guards
  drive the real unit radio (the four tests #80 shipped with all run Imperial,
  which is why nothing caught it): the tool's answer follows the physical
  station in either system, and the field re-seeds rather than being reread —
  the second fails on the pre-fix code. Practice 4 takes the class with them: a
  source guard across `app_shell/`, `oracle_app/` and `app/views/` fails any
  `st.number_input` seeded with a converted value whose key does not carry the
  active system, with the two pre-`unit_number_input` key helpers it tolerates
  checked rather than trusted.

- **The max-continuous-HP precedence is written once and read everywhere
  (#124, tier S, 2026-08-28; production-release review §3.1).** Step M2-6's rule
  — the engine-list total unless `override_max_continuous_hp` is set, the stored
  total as the fallback when no engine carries a rating — lived in
  [`weight_estimate.resolve_max_continuous_hp`](sloads/modules/weight_estimate.py)
  and again inline in [`app/views/weight_mass.py`](app/views/weight_mass.py),
  over a locally computed `sum(...)` where the owner used `math.fsum(...)`: two
  copies of one rule, agreeing on the day they were written, which is the drift
  practice 3 forbids. The view could not simply call the owner — it takes a
  `Project` and refuses one without a `weight.estimation`, while the page holds
  the form's values before Apply writes them — so the precedence now lives in a
  new input-level `resolve_max_continuous_hp_for(estimation, engines)`, with the
  project-level function a thin wrapper that locates the slice and applies it,
  and `engine_list_max_continuous_hp(engines)` owning the sum the page shows
  beside the override switch. The view reads both; the inline copy is deleted.
  No behaviour change: the two copies agreed. The structural half is two guards
  in `tests/test_derived_geometry.py` — the entry points are pinned to one
  answer across the override/fallback/empty-list cases, and a headless render of
  the Weight & Mass page with an engine list deliberately disagreeing with the
  stored total checks its powerplant weight against the owner's, in both
  override states, with the two required to differ so neither check can pass
  vacuously. Verified: reinstating a drifted inline copy fails the page guard.

- **A half-entered planform is refused by name instead of crashing the page (#71, PB-21, tier S, 2026-08-25).**
  The oracle GUI's curve editor persists a one-point leading or trailing edge
  after the first complete row, and Wing Loads answered that with a raw
  `IndexError` traceback rather than a note. Every strip sweep now asks one
  precondition — `derived_geometry.require_integrable_planform` (two or more
  points per edge, butt lines ordered inboard → outboard, two or more
  integration elements) and `require_positive_planform_area` for what can only
  be known after the sweep — so the refusal names the surface and what is wrong
  with it, and the page shows it as "cannot run yet". It stays a plain
  `ValueError`, not a `MissingInputError`: a mid-entry planform is
  present-but-invalid input, so a run-all or an sbeam export refuses it rather
  than skipping the wing and shipping a deck without one.

- **Four more sites of the same class, found by sweeping for it (#71, tier S, 2026-08-25).**
  The finding named one function. Five walk the edge polylines strip by strip,
  and only two carried the check: `tail_geometry`'s two polyline integrals
  reached `[0]` on an empty tail edge and came back through SELECT and the
  balance as an `IndexError`, the Schrenk distribution had the point check but
  still divided by an area of zero, and `wing_inertia` had nothing. Coincident
  edges, a zero span, a repeated butt line and a trailing edge entered ahead of
  the leading edge are all ordinary mid-entry states and all produced a bare
  `float division by zero`, which `_NOT_READY` deliberately does not catch. The
  gear-placement consistency check, which renders on every page, now skips a
  planform still being typed rather than interpolating it.

- **The broad `except` around the wing-area resolver is narrowed (#70 follow-up, tier S, 2026-08-25).**
  `validation` and the field registry caught `(ValueError, ZeroDivisionError,
  StopIteration)` around `planform_area_sqft` because the calc underneath could
  still divide by zero. It cannot now, so both catch the declared `ValueError`.

- **Design note 32 described a GUI that had moved on** (PB-24, issue #74, tier S,
  2026-08-25). The oracle-GUI note is a live plan, not a historic record, and six
  of its statements no longer matched the code it plans: OG-4 named
  `_has_unsaved_changes` / `_confirm_discard` / `_load_with_guard` in
  `app/components.py`, which shipped as the public `app_shell/project_state.py`
  API; OG-8's gear-duplication prerequisite was closed by note 33 DS-1 / #52 and
  guarded, and both it and review 2026-08-20 §7's "not satisfied" now say so;
  gate G7's *statement* still promised "the parametrized ultimate-contract scan"
  and §5 still leaned on it, although OG-9 — the item that would have built it —
  was withdrawn in full on 2026-08-20 and the gate as shipped reads the payload
  bytes instead.
- **`supplied` was documented as a field written behind the user's back** (PB-24,
  #74, tier S, 2026-08-25). Note 32's G5 row, the registry's own comment, its
  `supplied_paths` docstring and two test docstrings all read "a field the oracle
  GUI *writes* without asking" — and all thirteen supplied paths are rendered
  widgets the user can see and change. Several are *seeded* with a meaningful
  default rather than left empty (a surface name, a CG case's role), which is
  where the reading came from, but seeding a field the user then edits is not
  writing it behind their back, and a mark documented that way invites a GUI that
  hides them. Corrected in all five places.
- **Every field count in note 32 was a present-tense claim about a moving
  number** (PB-24, #74, tier S, 2026-08-25). The registry has been 323 fields /
  219 `ORIGINAL` / 11 supplied and 230 fields on 35 groups since 2026-08-19; it
  is 297 / 199 / 13 and 212 on 34 groups today, and the oracle page count went
  from 13 to 14 with nothing noticing. Each measurement now carries the date it
  was taken, the section that leans on them carries a one-line recount command,
  and the live page count points at its owner (`workflow.oracle_step_keys()`) and
  the guard that holds it — rather than being re-frozen at a value that will
  drift again.

- **Coefficients in the oracle GUI were displayed rounded to four decimals**
  (PB-22, issue #73, tier S, 2026-08-25). Every float widget carried
  `format="%.4f"`, so FLTLOADS' airplane-less-tail polynomials showed as
  `0.3205` and `0.0041` where the project held `0.320479` and `0.004128`. The
  stored value was never touched — but this GUI exists for a persona who reads
  the coefficients off the screen to check them against the manual, and a
  coefficient the screen rounds is one nobody can check. Precision is now a
  property of the quantity rather than of the page: `sloads.units.display_format`
  answers per `FieldUnit` — `%g` for a dimensionless value, four decimals for one
  carrying a unit, where `%g`'s six significant figures would *lose* precision on
  a station or an area — and no renderer in `oracle_app/` or `app_shell/` may
  write a format string of its own.
- **Fields whose leaf name is a code rather than a word were labelled with the
  code** (PB-22, #73, tier S, 2026-08-25). *Xt25*, *Xv50*, *Fwd Regardless Pct
  MAC* and *Elevator Aft Hinge* (an area aft of the hinge line, not a fitting)
  name nothing to a reader who does not already know the schema. ~20 of them are
  now hand-declared in `oracle_app/labels.py` beside the spelling table, with the
  same guard `MEMBER_LABELS` carries: a label for a field that is not in the
  input set fails the suite. An override replaces the field's *name* and never
  its unit, so a deflection cannot lose its degrees on the way through.
- **A rate in rad/s was labelled "Design Pitch Rate Rad (s)"** (PB-22, #73,
  tier S, 2026-08-25). The unit-suffix table was matched in declaration order,
  so `design_pitch_rate_rad_s` matched `_s` before `_rad_s` — the unit split in
  half with the other half left in the name. Matched longest-first now.
- **The one V-n field whose name gives no clue had help naming a different
  quantity** (PB-22, #73, tier S, 2026-08-25). `flight_loads.mn`'s registry basis
  read "FLTLOADS gust/manoeuvre matrix"; it is the Mach number the aero
  coefficients were obtained at (~0.1, FLTLOADS.BAS line 138), not a design Mach.
  The tooltip is built from the basis, so the row was the fix.
- **The airspeed unit nested its own parentheses** (PB-22, #73, tier S,
  2026-08-25). Widgets append a unit as `label (unit)`, and the unit string was
  `kt (EAS)` — *Chosen Vc (kt (EAS))*. It is **KEAS** now, the one word
  `CONVENTIONS.md` and every help string in the tool already use, declared once
  in `sloads/units.py` and re-exported by `app_shell/components.py` instead of
  spelled separately in both. A group of fields held on the project itself is
  captioned as such rather than as a schema path `` `(project)` `` that does not
  exist.

- **Four oracle-GUI acceptance gates were asserting less than they read as
  (PB-10 … PB-13, issue #67, tier S, 2026-08-25).** G2 checked that the
  navigation *expression* mentions `oracle_steps()` by walking the source, which
  stays true of a page set that has been filtered or re-ordered; it now runs the
  entry point and asserts the page set actually registered
  (`app_shell.nav.PAGES`) is `oracle_steps()`, in order, with one default, the
  source scan kept as a drift hint. G8/OG-10, the lint gate and the shell
  back-import test all scoped themselves to "directories holding a module-level
  `set_page_config`", so wrapping `Oracle.py`'s call in a helper would have
  removed `oracle_app/` from all four at once with CI green — discovery is now
  by directory, pinned against a literal `{app, oracle_app}`. The Imperial→SI
  factor scan was two hand-typed literal lists (eight numbers in
  `test_oracle_gui.py`, five others in `test_units.py`, neither reading
  `app_shell/` or `oracle_app/`), replaced by one scan derived from `units.py`'s
  own constants and matched numerically against the float literals of all four
  packages; `test_constants.py`'s package list was swept the same way (rule 4).
  G7 ran on one airplane in one unit system, where `one_engine_out` is blocked
  and `body_loads` has no conditions — two pages asserted over an empty artifact
  list, and the SI conversion never applied; it now runs over a single **and** a
  twin, one unit system each, with a guard that every page running a program
  offers a file on at least one of them. Each strengthened gate was
  mutation-tested. Also corrected: G7's text half claimed byte equality with
  `cli.py` for every module, which is untrue of `engine` (the CLI prints
  `text_report` — the same body under an engine/propeller identification
  header); the gate pins the shared body of the two owners instead.

- **Fields the user must state are no longer filtered off the oracle pages
  (#98, C210-46/49/29, tier M, 2026-08-27).** One cause — the `_SLDS`-origin
  filter — and the same failure three ways, now closed as two guarded classes
  plus a generated caption. **Row selectors** (`tab_loads.tabs[].surface`,
  `tail_mass[].surface`, `aero.surfaces[].name`): a page resolves a *scalar*
  surface selector positionally, never a *row's*, so hiding one hardcoded every
  row — every tab was silently an h-tail tab (wrong case-ID band, export tag
  and BL-vs-WL station reading) and a rudder or aileron tab could not be
  entered at all. They are rendered now (selectboxes over the
  `TAB_SURFACES`/`TAIL_SURFACES` vocabularies), an unknown surface is **refused
  by name** (`models.inputs.require_surface`) where it used to be silently
  filed under `wing` or silently inert, and
  `test_a_list_row_selector_is_always_asked` fails structurally on the next
  hidden one. **Sentinel defaults** (both gear legs' `carrier`, `attach`,
  `weight_lb`): defaults that mean "not stated" — the export assumes or omits
  the leg's node and no ground case is deliverable — are registered in
  `field_registry.SENTINEL_DEFAULTS` (each entry citing its refusing consumer),
  rendered, and guarded by `test_a_sentinel_default_field_is_always_asked`.
  **Empty lists** (C210-29's caption half; the seed half shipped with #97): an
  empty list table used to be a bare rows counter with no trace of the whole
  AIRLOADS block it hid; it now captions every field the page holds behind a
  row, **generated from the page's own field set** so every empty list in the
  GUI gains it and the caption cannot drift when a field is added. Each new
  `supplied` mark is demonstrated load-bearing in `tests/test_oracle_inputs.py`.

- **Oracle page placement moves, the load-bearing zero tail CP is refused, and
  a crash names its line (tier M, 2026-08-26, #99).** C210-37/44 (owner
  directives): the aileron/flap planform geometry (areas, deflection limits,
  chord ratio) and `engine_layout` render on the Geometry page beside the
  empennage forms — the rows keep their slices, the placement is the registry
  page tag, and a drift guard holds the decision; the Engine Mount page's
  layout-consistency message now names both owning pages. C210-21: `xtc`/`xtf`
  at their 0.0 default put the tail CP at the datum, sign-flip the tail arm and
  balance silently wrong — `build_envelope` refuses the station a config in
  play would read, by name, and `tail_cp_station_unset` warns on the Flight
  Envelope page before anything runs. C210-14: `landing_light_not_lighter`
  warns when a `fwd_light` case weighs exactly the max landing weight — the
  role claims the light corner while the numbers answer the heavy question.
  C210-24 (the display half of #71): a not-ready result block keeps its
  friendly one-liner but adds the exception type and carries the traceback,
  module:line first, in an expander — a from-blank user can report *where* it
  died without leaving the GUI.

- **A page states the later page its numbers depend on (#69, PB-15/PB-19, tier M, 2026-08-25).**
  Flap Loads computes its FAR 23.457(b) slipstream case from an engine record entered
  two pages later, and WTESTIMA correlates against the engine list's combined power
  rather than the horsepower typed beside it. Run either page first and it showed a
  complete-looking answer that moved once the Engine page was filled — ~19 % of the
  governing flap load on the C210, the slipstream being a whole delivered case that
  did not exist yet — with nothing on the page saying the dependency existed.
  `WorkflowStep.reads` now declares those dependencies and
  `app_shell.components.render_page_order_reads` states them: the slice and the page
  that enters it on every visit, escalating from caption to warning while that page
  is still empty. `requires` was the wrong instrument — it blocks, and both calcs are
  correct with no engine at all. Seven declarations across four steps (Geometry,
  Weight & Mass, Balanced Cases, Flap Loads), found by sweep rather than by report.
- **A copy whose owner is not a field is marked too (#69, C210-41 step 1, tier M, 2026-08-25).**
  `_copy_note` returned early on `owner_is_external`, so the half of the registry that
  records "owned, but not by a field" was dark: engine weight and CG (owner: the weight
  database, D-25), the engine-mount limit load factor (the computed 23.337 limit), and
  the weight estimate's engine count and horsepower all rendered as silent peer inputs.
  All six are now captioned with their owner in words. They are never disabled — an
  external owner is an expression with no value to substitute, and one of them is the
  fallback the calc uses when the owner is empty — and where `governs` alone would
  state the rule wrongly the row carries the true sentence in a new `FieldEntry.resolves`.

- **An `AppTest` script was permanently stubbing a real module** (found while working
  #79, tier S, 2026-08-26). `AppTest.from_string` execs its script in the *running*
  process, so `_NO_ARTIFACT_SCRIPT`'s `r.step_results = lambda …` (added with #89) rebound
  the attribute on `oracle_app.results` for the rest of the session — every later test
  that imported it got a one-block stub for a page called "flap". Harmless when written,
  because nothing after it read `step_results`; it stopped being harmless the moment
  something did, and the symptom was a `KeyError` in an unrelated test that came and went
  with the xdist worker split. Restored in a `finally` (the stub is the point of that
  test), and a new guard reads every `*_SCRIPT` constant and fails on any other
  module-attribute assignment — including in the one script that is a `str.format`
  template and cannot be parsed, which is scanned textually so it cannot become the hole.

- **Row 17 is split by mechanism, note 34 reaches AGREED, and the suite-runtime
  row is re-measured (tier S, 2026-08-26).** Three corrections to the 0.8.0
  record, none of them a code change. **The split:** the C210 family the
  2026-08-24 re-cut folded into row 17 was 26 findings across 14 pages sharing
  nothing but a review date, and its one tier-L member — TAILDIST recording the
  aero state of each case — would have gated twenty-five presentation findings
  behind a schema change. It is now five rows by mechanism: the text-only
  residue stays at row 17 (#94), the derive-by-default overrides go to #97, the
  fields filtered off the page to #98, the placement/validation pair to #99, and
  the tier-L aero-state contract to #100, which carries its own design-note-first
  requirement.
- **Design note 34 (oracle GUI user guide) moves PROPOSED → AGREED**, milestone
  0.8.0. Its four open questions were answered by the owner on 2026-08-25 as
  UG-9 … UG-12, but the note carried them for a day still marked PROPOSED — the
  state that blocked note 32's step OG-B and would have blocked the guide's
  first chapter under `CLAUDE.md` rule 1.
- **The suite-runtime revisit clause (#92) is re-measured, and the figure that
  tripped it was a coverage-instrumented run.** Plain `pytest`, the documented
  local command: 62.1 / 62.7 s, one call over 16 s, none over 30 s — inside all
  three of the clause's thresholds. Under `--cov=sloads` with
  `COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon`, as CI's coverage leg runs it: 265.6 s, 13 calls over
  16 s and 8 over 30 s, reproducing the recorded 269 s. The test named as the
  critical-path floor at the trip measures 2.3 s in isolation and enters the top
  20 in neither mode. The row keeps both readings and states the scoping
  question it now poses — close as no-longer-tripped, or re-aim at the coverage
  leg that gates the push to `main` — as the owner's to answer.

- **A file opened in either GUI now says it was migrated (PB-14, issue #68,
  tier S, 2026-08-25).** `apply_schema_check` asked
  `new_project.schema_version` — but `project_from_dict` runs `migrate`, which
  stamps the dict at the current `SCHEMA_VERSION` before the shell ever sees it,
  so the status was always `ok` and the 🔁 *"Migrated from schema N to 55"*
  notice could not fire: a v41 file (every bundled example) opened, was
  upgraded, and would be rewritten at v55 on save with nothing said. The
  pre-migration version is a fact about the raw dict and now has one reader,
  `io.source_schema_version`, with `io.read_project_dict` splitting the file read
  out of `load_project` so the question can be asked before the hops run.
  `safe_load` takes the dict reader rather than a project builder and builds the
  project itself, which keeps the project and the version it came from together
  for every load action in both GUIs; the JSON editor's Apply had the same dead
  check and was swept in the same change. The now-redundant stamp bump at both
  sites is gone — it was already current. Guards:
  `test_app_shell.py::test_opening_an_older_file_says_it_was_migrated` (a real
  v41 example through the sidebar, asserting the toast), its current-version
  twin, an AST guard that no GUI asks `schema_status` about a built object's
  stamp, and `test_io.py::test_the_version_a_file_was_written_at_survives_the_load`.

- **The weight/CG chart drew its `% MAC` column and its CG-limit lines from
  different wings** (#80, tier M). `X = XLEMAC + (pct/100)·MAC` was spelled four
  times, and the spellings disagreed about the prior question the relation
  cannot answer for itself — *which* XLEMAC and MAC. WTENV preferred the typed
  `weight.envelope.xlemac`/`mac` override and fell back to the planform; the
  report's envelope-corner table inverted the relation over the planform alone.
  On a project carrying an override the vertical limit lines and the `% MAC`
  column beside them therefore described different references, on one chart,
  with nothing saying so. No shipped example sets the override — which is why
  this was invisible and why nothing in the frozen Imperial baseline moves — so
  the guard makes one disagree on purpose. `sloads/derived_geometry.py` now owns
  the resolution and both directions of the relation (`mac_reference`,
  `pct_mac_to_station`, `station_to_pct_mac`), and an AST scan over `sloads/`,
  `app/`, `app_shell/` and `oracle_app/` fails on a fifth spelling.
- **Two more MAC-frame quantities were computed locally** (#80, generalised from
  the above). The tail-volume neutral point and the 25%-MAC CG estimate in
  `modules/configuration.py`, and the static-margin sweep's station→%MAC
  conversion in `app/views/flight_envelope.py`, each open-coded the same
  arithmetic. All three now share the relation while passing a **planform**
  reference explicitly: they are aerodynamic quantities, so the weight
  envelope's override deliberately does not reach them, and saying so in one
  line is what stops the next reader from "fixing" it the other way.

- **The §3.5 release smoke gate boots both front-ends, not just the first one
  (#127, tier S, 2026-08-28; production-release review §3.2).** `smoke_test.sh`
  started `app/Home.py` and nothing else, so the release whose headline
  deliverable is the oracle GUI had no hard gate that launched it under a real
  server. It now boots each front-end in turn through one `smoke_gui` function —
  identical terms, its own port, its own log — and the oracle GUI is started the
  way a user meets it, through the **`sloads-oracle` console script**
  `pyproject.toml` binds to `oracle:main` (falling back to `python oracle.py` in
  a checkout with no install, and saying which it took). That is the half the
  existing coverage missed: `AppTest` already reaches `Oracle.py`'s
  `set_page_config`, `st.navigation` and sidebar context manager in-process, and
  `test_the_launcher_points_at_the_entry_point` proves the path *resolves* — only
  a real boot proves the launcher launches. `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §3.5 names both.
  The structural half lives in `tests/test_ci_conformance.py`, whose defect class
  this is (a documented setting differing from the live one in silence): the
  front-ends are **found**, not listed — every top-level `.py` that calls
  `st.set_page_config`, which is one per GUI — and the gate must boot every one
  of them and the checklist must name every one it boots. A third front-end
  joins the comparison by existing. Both guards verified to fail on a mutation.

- **The shell's unit radio beat a loaded project's own unit system, and the
  disabled wing-area copy showed a number the analysis does not use**
  (PB-16, PB-17, issue #70, tier M, 2026-08-25). `unit_system` is a field of
  `Project`, so the sidebar radio is a project-seeded widget; it was exempted
  from the project-generation stamp as "the user's choice", and its retained
  state therefore beat `index=` — opening an SI-saved file in an Imperial
  session put `imperial` back on the file and reported it *unsaved* before the
  user had touched anything. It now carries the stamp like every other widget
  seeded from the project, and the exemption list has a behavioural guard
  beneath it: loading any shipped example through the shell must leave it clean.
  Separately, `speeds.wing_area_sqft` was registered as a display-only copy of
  `geometry.parametric.wing_area_sqft` while STRSPEED integrates the
  `speeds.wing_surface` **planform** — so the disabled widget stated 500.0 where
  the answer used 497.75 on `concept_regional_jet`, and two unrelated numbers on
  a hand-typed project. The row now names the planform as its owner and the
  widget shows the resolved area, from the same function the calc calls; where
  no such surface exists the field is what STRSPEED actually reads, so it goes
  live instead of being disabled against its own error message's advice.
- **The wing planform integral had four implementations and the wing-area
  mismatch warning printed twice on one page and never on the other**
  (#70, tier M, 2026-08-25). `structural_speeds`, `landing`, `validation` and
  `derived_geometry` each performed the strip integral; the guard that was
  supposed to prevent this scanned `sloads/modules/` only and allowlisted two of
  them, so `validation.py` grew a third copy outside its view. There is now one
  owner, `derived_geometry.planform_area_sqft` — the callers keep their own
  policy for an absent planform (LGFACTOR refuses, STRSPEED falls back) and none
  of them keeps the arithmetic — and the guard covers all of `sloads/`.
  `_check_area_mismatch` returned its warning tagged for Configuration & Layout
  twice, so that page printed the same sentence twice and Design Speeds, where
  the disagreement decides which number is integrated, printed it not at all.
- **A caption quoting an owner's value quoted it in Imperial on an SI page**
  (#70, tier S, 2026-08-25). The copy marks state the governing number beside a
  widget that converts, so an SI reader was shown kilograms in the box and
  pounds in the caption. `oracle_app.form._shown` converts and labels it.

### Removed

- **Pre-production schema floor: a project file is read at the current version, or refused (#93, tier L, 2026-08-25).**
  The twelve migration hops (v18→v55) and the v0 bare-`EngineInput` branch are gone, and
  `SUPPORTED_FLOOR` is now `SCHEMA_VERSION`. `migrations.migrate` raises the new
  `SchemaVersionError` — a `ValueError`, so it lands in the documented error contract — for a
  file that is older, newer or unversioned, naming both versions. The gate is raised once,
  inside `io.project_from_dict`, so CLI and both GUIs refuse identically; `io.schema_status`
  and the shell's `apply_schema_check` notice path went with it. This project is
  pre-production: no analysis made with an earlier build has to stay readable, and refusing is
  more honest than reshaping someone else's schema into this build's answer.
  The hop machinery is kept, empty — at production the floor drops and hops register from the
  then-current version forward, unchanged in shape.

- **Flutter clearance (MFC / V(FC)) is gone from the tool** (C210-19, issue #79, tier M,
  2026-08-26). `MACHLIM.BAS` computes `MFC = 1.2·MD` and a per-altitude
  `V(FC) = MFC·a·√σ`, and this port reproduced both. Flutter substantiation is
  **14 CFR 23.629**, not a design load — nothing in this suite sizes structure to MFC —
  and the symbol makes it worse rather than clearer: a Part 25 reader takes `VFC`/`MFC`
  for **§25.253's** maximum-speed-for-stability pair, a different quantity under a
  different definition. Removed on the owner's directive from the calc
  (`mach_limit.py`), the report's plot series **and its `V(MFC) (KEAS)` workbook
  column**, the Speed–Altitude chart in the main GUI (whose constant-Mach fan reached
  `1.2·MD + 0.05` and now reaches `MD + 0.05`), and the theory document. **MNE = 0.9·MD
  and the V(MC)/V(MNE)/V(MD) lines are untouched and stay oracle-locked.**
- **The dropped Appendix A output is registered as a scope withdrawal, not a
  correction** (#79, tier M, 2026-08-26). Appendix A p160 prints MFC 0.4836 and the
  oracle test asserted it to ±0.1 % until this date; we now decline to compute it, and
  the printed figure stands uncontradicted.
  `docs/20_theory/02_approved_corrections.md` gains a **third category** for that: its
  existing entries say *the manual is wrong and here is the right number*, which is the
  opposite claim. Guarded by
  `tests/test_mach_limit.py::test_no_shipped_module_computes_a_flutter_clearance_speed`,
  an AST scan of every shipped package — because the quantity was computed in **two**
  places, and deleting only the module's would have left the chart still drawing the
  line. **The VF half of #79 closes verified-correct:** every `VF` in code and docs is
  the 23.345 design flap speed, with no flutter conflation anywhere.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- **The stall-CL fill runs for the GUI that builds a slice field by field, and a
  zero stall CL is refused instead of divided by (C210-23, issue #81, tier M,
  2026-08-24).** The M1-1b fill lived in `AeroCoefficientsInput.__post_init__`,
  which runs when a slice is *constructed*. The oracle GUI never constructs one:
  it creates the coefficient sets blank and writes the CLmax trio afterwards, one
  widget per rerun. So the live sets kept `stall_cl = 0.0`, and Flight Envelope
  and SELECT — where every stall speed is `√(n·W/(CL·S))` — died with "cannot run
  yet — float division by zero" on a from-blank build, which is precisely the
  session the exercise exists to test. Saving and reloading fixed it, because the
  loader constructs. Same shape as C210-4: an invariant enforced in one code path
  and bypassed by another.
- **One owner, called from both paths.** `AeroCoefficientsInput.normalize()`
  holds the fill (fill-if-missing, both directions, never overwriting an authored
  value — ga6's `clmax_clean` 1.4068 and per-config `stall_cl` 1.41 legitimately
  differ and must both survive). `__post_init__` calls it for every slice built
  in one go, including the main GUI's Apply, which rebuilds the whole slice and
  was never affected. `sloads.derived.NORMALIZED_SLICES` calls it for a slice
  assembled field by field, through the `refresh_derived` the oracle form already
  runs after every persist — so the fix needed no new call site in the GUI, and
  none of the OG-2/G2 page-key problem that comes with adding one. `normalize`
  returns whether it wrote and is idempotent by value, which is what lets a
  render pass call it without dirtying a project it only visited (M2-3).
- **A derived slice and a normalized slice are different things, and the tables
  say so.** `DERIVED_SLICES` holds *results* the project could rebuild from
  scratch and which the field registry excludes from the input set (`mass`);
  `NORMALIZED_SLICES` holds authored *input* made self-consistent
  (`aero_coeffs`). Guarded both ways in `tests/test_derived.py`, so an input slice
  cannot drift into the G5 reduction's drop-and-re-derive path.
- **The consumer refuses rather than dividing (the #84 lesson).**
  `balance_configs` — the choke point `build_envelope` and `trim_sweep` share —
  now raises `MissingInputError` naming the set, the quantity and the page it is
  entered on, in the shape STRSPEED already uses for the same missing input. The
  fill is what keeps this from firing; the refusal is what makes every future
  writer safe, including one that bypasses `refresh_derived`.
- **Rule-4 sweep, and where it stops.** The other two `__post_init__`
  normalizations in `inputs.py` (`speeds.category`, `gear.strut`) are
  constrained-choice fields rendered as selectors, so no GUI edit can defeat
  them. The mirror-image case — CLmax entered per-config but not at the top level
  — was already refused by name in STRSPEED (`_stall_speeds`). **The sweep item in
  the issue cannot be closed as written**: `flaps_down.neg_stall_cl` is not a
  forgotten fill but a field with **no source** — there is no `clmax_flap_neg`,
  and the clean value is a different number (Appendix A's landing set prints
  −0.41 against a clean −0.59, so filling from clean would inject a 44 % error).
  Left at 0 it does not crash; `_balanced_point` clamps the band to
  `[0, +CLmax]`, so the 0-g point and the down gust at VF come back quietly
  small. Now warned (`aero_flap_neg_stall_unset`, page `aero_coefficients`)
  rather than guessed at; the schema field that would let it fill symmetrically
  is filed separately, being a schema/contract change.
- **Guarded on the real path**, not a stand-in for it:
  `tests/test_oracle_gui.py::test_the_aero_page_fills_the_stall_cl_it_was_given_field_by_field`
  renders the actual page with the actual broken live slice and then requires
  `build_envelope` to run — the reported symptom, gone without a save-and-reload.
  Note that no shipped fixture carries a `flaps_down` set at all, so nothing in
  CI exercises the flap envelope today.

- **The oracle GUI shows the entry-error warnings it was already computing, and
  two page tags stopped naming pages that do not exist (C210-35, issue #82,
  tier M, 2026-08-24).** `sloads.validation.consistency_warnings` is part of the
  analysis contract, and `oracle_app`/`app_shell` had **no consumer of
  `ConsistencyWarning` at all** — so a page-targeted entry-error channel was dark
  exactly where entries are made. On the C210 build that meant six detected
  contradictions were never shown, including both `wing_fraction`-on-a-wing-row
  entries; the 85-lb wing-tie gap they caused took three GUI round-trips to close
  and was found only by reading the saved file off-GUI.
  `app_shell.components.render_consistency_warnings(project, key)` is now the
  **only** consumer in either front-end, called by `page_header` from the step key
  it already holds — so every page opening with the shared header shows its own
  warnings, in `app/` and in `oracle_app/` alike, with nothing to remember per
  page. The six open-coded loops in `app/views` are gone;
  `aero_coefficients.py` and `export_report.py` moved onto `page_header`
  (`banner=False`, so nothing but the warnings changed on them); the Design
  Speeds page keeps its deliberate re-statement of the one warning whose subject
  *is* its operational-limitations tab, now through an `only_codes=` filter.
- **Two `page` tags named pages that no longer existed.** `weight_cg_inertia`
  (the weights page has been `weight_mass` since Step G3) and `wing_geometry`
  (merged into `configuration_layout` at Step G1) covered **19 checks — 14 of
  them the weights group, the largest in the module** — and were reachable only
  because two views in `app/` compared against the old strings by hand. Every tag
  is now a `sloads.workflow.STEPS` key: `workflow.py` is the nav SSOT, so a tag
  naming anything else names a page no GUI has. Rule-3 drift guard
  (`tests/test_validation.py`) asserts it over both the `PAGE_*` constants and
  the tags the live checks actually emit across four fixtures, so a new check
  with a typo'd page fails there rather than rendering nowhere. Two oracle-GUI
  guards read the **rendered** warnings (`tests/test_oracle_gui.py`): the
  contradictory wing row shows on the page that owns it, and does *not* show on
  one that does not — targeting honoured, not ignored. Warnings tagged
  `export_report` stay main-GUI-only: the oracle GUI has no export page and no
  way to set a safety-factor override, so the guard permits a tag that is a
  workflow key without being an oracle step (OG-2 scope).

- **The flap slipstream amplification is delivered, not just printed — the
  exported flap case was understated by the whole factor (C210-47, issue #85,
  tier M, 2026-08-24).** FAR 23.457(b)'s slipstream factor was computed,
  published as a `LoadValue` and then dropped: `build_flap` shipped
  `max(critical, gust-combined)` uniformly as the one exported flap case, so the
  C210 deck carried 972.8 lbs-ULT where the 23.345(d)/23.457(b) design load
  inside the band is 1,156.6 — **19 % low on shipped content**. FLAPLOAD.BAS
  printing the factor and leaving the application to the designer is defensible
  for a printed report; a solver deck has no such excuse. `build_flap` now emits
  the slipstream as a **second case** (`W-61`) beside the gust-combined one
  (`W-60`), with its own `ConditionResult` so the report prints the governing
  number, and the two are **enveloped, never multiplied** — a 25 fps head-on
  gust and full takeoff power at VF are independent worst cases (owner ruling).
  The delivered load is `factor × the VF-governed condition`: the factor is
  `(Vss/VF)²`, a ratio of dynamic pressures *at VF*, so scaling a load computed
  at VSF by it would multiply a `q` it has no relation to (on the manual's own
  airplane the critical condition *is* 2G at VF, so this is `factor × critical`
  there). The factor applies over the **whole** flap — `ControlSurfaceLoadResult`
  carries chord fractions and no span, which is why the deck emits no `GRID` —
  so the whole-surface application is conservative and is stated on the case
  rather than implied; a per-strip banded envelope needs a spanwise axis on the
  result type and is left as the L-tier schema change it is. No printed oracle
  exists for the applied load, so the gate is a stated closure (rule 2):
  `factor × max(LF 2G-at-VF, LF gust-at-VF)` = 1.407 × 629 = 885 lb on the
  Appendix A airplane, not the two factors stacked, and an engine-less project
  exports byte-identically to before. The frozen Imperial digests were
  regenerated for the intended flap-channel change on the propeller examples.
- **The main GUI's whole slipstream block had never rendered (found closing
  #85, folded in per rule 4).** `app/views/flap_loads.py` tested
  `if "Slipstream factor" in vals:` against a dict keyed by `LoadValue.key`, so
  the condition was always False and the 23.457(b) block was dead from the day
  it was written — the smoke tests passed over it in silence because a block
  that never renders raises nothing. The page now reads the key, flattens `vals`
  across every reported condition (the slipstream is its own condition since
  #85), and shows the flap load in the slipstream beside the factor and band.
  Guards: the page's rendered elements are asserted to carry the slipstream
  block on a propeller project (read the artifact, not the source — the G7
  lesson), and, since this was the only such line in `app/views`, a rule-3 drift
  guard states as an absolute that no view may test a display label against a
  key-dict (`tests/test_views_smoke.py`).

- **The flap page says when it skips the 23.457(b) slipstream case, instead of
  printing a quietly understated load (C210-40, issue #83, tier S, 2026-08-24).**
  `flap.py` computes the propeller-slipstream term only when the engine record
  supplies both a power and a propeller diameter. With no such record the Flap
  Loads page still collects the slipstream band's geometry (AF, BLPROP), reads it
  for nothing, and prints a critical flap load with a first-order amplification
  absent and no trace — the manual's own example prints ×1.407 (Ref 1 Appendix A
  p201). Since #85 that is not a factor left unprinted but a **delivered case
  that does not exist**, so the flap and its attachments are sized on the
  gust-combined load alone. A `consistency_warnings` entry
  (`flap_slipstream_skipped`, tagged `flap_loads`) now names the skip, what is
  missing from the engine record, and the page that fixes it; AF and BLPROP
  caption their engine-record dependency in both GUIs (the main GUI through
  `help=`, the oracle GUI through the field registry's basis string).
- **The predicate is the module's own skip condition, not a copy of it.**
  `flap.slipstream_is_available(project)` states `maxhp > 0 and pdia_in > 0`
  once; `validation` reads it, and a test walks the partial records — power with
  no propeller, a propeller with no power — asserting the warning fires *exactly*
  when `_compute` skips the term, so the two cannot drift.
- **It fires on the entered band, not on the absent engine.** `EngineType` has
  no jet member, so `concept_regional_jet`'s turbofans are stored as TURBOPROP
  with a zero propeller diameter and are indistinguishable from an unentered
  piston record by type alone. Keying on AF/BLPROP — the evidence a slipstream
  was intended — keeps the check silent on jets and gliders and true to the
  module's "no warnings on well-formed input" contract; the schema gap is filed
  separately. The residual is stated rather than hidden: an airplane that enters
  neither AF nor BLPROP and has no engine still gets the understated load
  unwarned.
- **The main GUI's flap page joined the shared header, so this is not an
  oracle-GUI-only warning.** `app/views/flap_loads.py` opened with a bare
  `st.title`, which #82's renderer (hung off `page_header`) never reaches — the
  warning would have appeared in one GUI and not the other, the exact divergence
  #82 was written to end. It now calls `page_header("flap_loads", banner=False)`,
  so nothing but the warnings changed on it. Guards read the **rendered**
  warning in both front-ends (`tests/test_views_smoke.py`,
  `tests/test_oracle_gui.py`), and the GA fixture asserts silence where the
  slipstream *is* computed.
- **Rule-4 sweep (defect class: an upstream record's absence silently degrading a
  delivered number).** Every other conditional skip in `sloads/modules` was
  checked and none is this defect: `configuration._stability_condition` /
  `_gear_geometry` / `wing_geometry._engine_stations` return `None` and the whole
  block is visibly absent; `configuration`'s prop-clearance omits its one
  `LoadValue`; `weight_estimate.resolve_max_continuous_hp` falls back to the
  stored figure with the fallback named in its docstring; `balance`'s hub thrust
  applies nothing from `None` and says so. The flap slipstream was the only site
  where the number kept printing while quietly losing a term.

- **The loader stores numbers, not the text a grid happened to write (C210-7
  residual, issue #76, tier S, 2026-08-24).** `io._points` coerced a polyline's
  *shape* (JSON array → tuple) and passed its members through, so a project saved
  mid-entry — the C210-7 state, where an object-typed grid column hands every
  typed cell back as text — reloaded with `("45", "0")` where a wing corner
  belongs. The file loaded cleanly and died later: `TypeError: unsupported
  operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'` at `wing_geometry.py:112`. The
  mitigation recorded at review time ("the fixed grid repairs them on the next
  Geometry render") turns out to be oracle-GUI-only — in the main GUI the same
  strings kill `to_display` at `configuration_layout.py:818`, which is the page
  that would have done the repairing. The loader is the only boundary that
  reaches both.
- **Stated for the class, not for the corner that found it (rule 4).** Reading
  the numeric containers off the model's own annotations turns up 18, of which
  exactly one — `FlightLoadsInput.altitudes_ft` — coerced. The rest arrived raw:
  both WINGGEOM polylines, the three aero curves (`twist`, `profile_drag`,
  `section_cm`), three `hinges_span_in` lists (an sbeam control-surface export
  input), `OneEngineOutInput.speeds_kt`, the three gear axle points, `attach`,
  and both engine vectors. All are grid-writable, which is how the strings are
  produced in the first place.
- **One rule, read off the annotations (rule 3).** `io._numeric_shape` /
  `_numeric_containers` derive `{field: shape}` from the dataclass type hints, so
  a numeric container added tomorrow is covered the day it is added rather than
  the day someone remembers a list. `_filtered` — the single splat gate every
  `*_from_dict` passes through — coerces on the way in; the three paths that
  bypass it (the polylines via `_points`, the engine vectors, the gear axles)
  call the same coercer instead of growing a second copy of the rule, and the
  hand-written `tuple(...)` passes in `_gear_from_dict` are gone. Guard:
  `tests/test_io.py::test_the_coerced_field_set_is_read_off_the_model_not_a_hand_list`
  asserts the rule over every dataclass in the model, and
  `test_every_numeric_container_survives_a_file_written_as_text` reloads the
  whole GA-6 fixture with every list member written as text and requires 17
  modules to return bit-identical values.
- **Repaired out loud, refused when unreadable.** `"45"` becomes `45.0` with a
  `warnings.warn` naming the field — the #66/PB-7 load-path channel, which
  `project_state.safe_load` renders as a toast — one warning per field, not per
  member, so a 20-point polyline is one message rather than forty. `"abc"` raises
  `ValueError: SurfaceInput.leading_edge[0][0] is 'abc', which is not a number`,
  one of the types the load path already catches and shows as `st.error`. A file
  saved during the crash still opens, which is what lets the grid finish the
  repair; a file that cannot be read as numbers is not guessed at.
- **Scope, deliberately.** Numeric *containers* only. Scalars are the same class
  one step wider, but blanket-coercing every numeric field has to reason about
  `Optional`, enums and bools, and no observed defect points at it. Residual: the
  JSON editor (`app/views/project_editor.py`) works on the raw dict rather than a
  loaded `Project`, so a string typed directly into it still reaches
  `to_display`; the units converter deliberately leaves non-numeric lists alone
  (`test_an_empty_or_mixed_list_is_left_alone`), which is also why no coerced
  value can be a millimetre read as an inch — a string corner was never scaled.

- **One Engine Out refuses the condition an airplane cannot have, instead of
  simulating nothing and calling it uncontrollable (C210-43, issue #84, tier M,
  2026-08-24).** FAR 23.367's yaw forcing is `thrust · BLENG` with
  `BLENG = |engine_cg[1]|`, identically zero for a single engine or for a multi
  whose *failed* engine sits on the centreline. Nothing gated it: the Euler march
  ran with no forcing in it and reported zero tail load, zero yaw rate and — since
  nothing ever moved back — `"NOT recovered within 60 s — the airplane is
  uncontrollable at this speed (likely below VMC)"`. A false uncontrollability
  verdict, on a condition the airplane does not have, with every thrust and
  windmill intermediate verifying to the digit beside it.
- **One predicate, three readers.**
  `applicability.engine_failure_not_applicable` states it once.
  `one_engine_out._case_inputs` refuses on it at the same choke point as the
  propeller-disc gate, so `run`, `time_history`, the CLI and the main GUI decline
  identically; the oracle GUI's `render_step` states the reason and **withholds
  the input form** — the #66/PB-7 shape one step earlier, since there is no input
  to take rather than merely nothing to show; and `report/coverage.py`'s 23.367
  row now reads it instead of its own `len(engines) > 1`, which called the
  centreline twin applicable. The report can no longer mark the condition
  analysable while the module declines it.
- **The main GUI's own gate was replaced, not duplicated.** `app/views/one_engine_out.py`
  carried a hand-written `len(project.engines) < 2` warning — right about the
  single, silent about the centreline twin, and worded differently from what the
  module said. It reads the shared predicate now. Its genuinely different case,
  an empty engine list, stays a `gate()` to the Engine Mount page: that is an
  unfinished project, not an airplane without the condition, and the form below
  indexes into the list.
- **Steps are keyed the way #82 taught.** `applicability._STEP_NOT_APPLICABLE`
  maps workflow step key → predicate, guarded by
  `tests/test_applicability.py::test_every_step_predicate_names_a_real_workflow_step`
  so a key naming a page no GUI has fails there rather than silently never
  running. The table lives in `sloads` rather than the front-end for a second
  reason the GUI's own guard enforced: the oracle GUI's page set is derived from
  `workflow` and may not write a step key as a literal (OG-2/G2).

- **The oracle GUI's row counter was a delete key, and the row it added broke the
  page it was added on (code review 2026-08-24, tier M).** `render_table` sized a
  list record by reconciling the model to a `st.number_input`, and `rows` is the
  project's **own attached list** — so both directions wrote to the project during
  a render pass. Counting down ran `rows.pop()`: typing `3` on the Weight & Mass
  page dropped 21 of 24 weight items with no confirmation and no undo, counting
  back up returned blanks, and a project truncated that way saved to disk. That is
  the scenario `app_shell/widget_keys.py` records as the reason the generation
  stamp exists (#51, which blocked the 0.7.0 cut) — the stamp closed the
  state-triggered path and left the user-triggered one open. The mass item
  database is the D-25b mass SSOT, so the loss reaches `Project.mass`, the CG
  cases, SELECT's inertias, the fuselage beam and every exported deck.
- **The same pop fired with no user interaction at all.** A retained count beats
  the model whenever the project is *mutated* rather than *replaced* — no
  generation bump covers that, which is exactly the remainder `02_parked.md` L-8d
  parks. Six items added by another writer vanished on the next render of the
  page. Latent today (nothing in the oracle GUI grows a registry list) and not
  latent for long: #78's item-table seeding is such a writer.
- **The model wins now, and deleting is a named click.** The counter still grows
  the list; counting down deletes nothing and instead says so, naming the rows at
  risk, with a `🗑 Delete the last N row(s)` button beside it. The counter was
  kept rather than replaced with an Add button on purpose: `tests/test_oracle_journey.py`
  types whole projects by setting widget values, and a button would have cost that
  harness for no gain in the defect.
- **A blank row is in the project at once, and one of them stops the calc.** The
  counter attaches a seeded row immediately — `commit_pending`'s blank-record rule
  (OG-F) governs records the pass *created*, not rows appended to an already
  attached list. For `weight.cg_cases` the seeded row is a `FLIGHT`-tagged case of
  zero weight at station 0, which `flight_cases` picks up and every balance
  divides by: the whole Flight Envelope and SELECT died on `ZeroDivisionError`
  one click after being asked for one more row. `build_envelope` now refuses a
  weightless case **by name** (the #81/#84 shape — the point that divides is the
  point that refuses), and `validation` warns before anything is run
  (`cg_case_without_weight`, page `weight_mass`).
- **The page said the opposite of what it did.** Its caption read *"Table rows with
  an empty cell are not saved — fill every column to keep the row."* True of grid
  cells (`_cell_in`'s NaN guard) and false of counter rows, which are saved blank.
  The caption now states both rules, so a user reading it is not told the tool
  protects them from the state it just created.
- **The catch that hid all of it (#71/PB-18, narrow half).** `_NOT_READY` included
  `ZeroDivisionError`, which is not a `ValueError`, is raised deliberately by no
  module, and never means "keep typing" — so a page that had been working reported
  *cannot run yet*, the sentence for an unfinished form. It is gone; the contract's
  own two halves (`MissingInputError`, `ValueError` for present-but-unusable)
  stay, because narrowing further breaks the documented contract — `torque_factor`
  raises a bare `ValueError` for a missing cylinder count, which the journey test
  caught immediately. The rest of #71 (exception type + expandable traceback,
  C210-24) stays with #73.

- **Tail Span Loads stated its moments in the engine's ft-lb channel — every
  figure 12x its label (C210-51, issue #86, tier S, 2026-08-24).** The module was
  never wrong: `tail_span` accumulates `sz * dy` with the span in inches and
  publishes `lb-in` on its own `LoadValue`s, which is why the oracle GUI's report
  read correctly and only the main GUI's page disagreed. But
  `app/views/tail_span_loads.py` rendered six lb-in quantities — root Mxx/Myy,
  the station table, the control-point torsion, the hinge moment (whose field is
  literally `hinge_moment_lbin`), the T-tail transfer and the station CSV —
  through the `torque` channel, whose Imperial label is **ft-lb**: Imperial
  figures read 12x their label, and SI applied the ft-lb→N·m factor to an lb-in
  number, so both systems were wrong by the same 12. Found by reading the C210
  station CSV: an htail `Mxx` of 42.857 "ft-lb" is 5.4945 lb x the 7.8 **in**
  station pitch. The page now derives one moment label and one converter from
  the `lb-in` channel its module produces — the call the wing, fuselage, landing
  and plots views already share, making this the fifth rather than the outlier.
  Guards (rule 3): no view outside the engine page may read the `torque` channel
  at all, and the page's moment label must be the unit its module publishes
  (`tests/test_deliverable_units.py`).

## [0.7.1] — 2026-08-23

### Added

- **A whole-project results zip in the shared sidebar (C210-45, backlog 19c,
  tier M, 2026-08-23).** "Build results zip" runs every registered module
  against the current project and serves one archive through the browser save
  dialog: `reports/<module>.txt` and `load_cases/<module>.csv` per module that
  ran — rendered by the same owners the CLI uses (`module_text_report`,
  `io.load_cases_csv` + the G8.3 basis statement) so the ULT marker and per-case
  SF are identical by construction — plus the serialized `.project.json` and a
  `MANIFEST.txt` stating every module's outcome (a page that refuses is skipped
  and listed, never silently absent). Both GUIs carry the button (shared
  `app_shell` sidebar); the built zip is keyed to the project's serialized
  identity, so an edit after Build invalidates the stale archive instead of
  serving it. Pure builder `sloads/report/results_zip.py`; payload guard
  `tests/test_results_zip.py` reads the artifact bytes (the G7 pattern).

### Changed

- **Every oracle page with a grid says that a part-filled row is not saved (C210 build review, tier S, 2026-08-23).**
  A grid row with an empty cell is deliberately held out of the project, which is
  invisible until the row vanishes on a rerun. Asked for by the owner mid-build:
  pages that render a `st.data_editor` now carry one caption ("fill every column to
  keep the row"), derived from the page's field set, absent on grid-less pages. The
  hint briefly also warned that Enter could drop an entry — that symptom was the
  C210-4 remount race (see the stable-frame fix in this release) and the warning
  came back out once the fix removed it. Guard:
  `tests/test_oracle_gui.py::test_grid_pages_carry_the_commit_hint`.

- **SELECT's search scope stated explicitly in the theory sources (review 2026-08-23
  C210-26, tier S, 2026-08-23).** The `select` row of
  `docs/20_theory/00_theory_sources.md` now opens with the scope the criteria always
  implied but no doc stated in one place: the candidate pool for every selection —
  wing, h-tail, v-tail and fuselage alike — is the entire balanced V-n matrix (every
  loading/CG × altitude combination FLTLOADS balanced), filtered only by condition
  label, with one governing case per category proceeding to the distributed-loads
  pass; 23.333(b)'s "each combination" requirement is discharged by FLTLOADS' full
  matrix, and the airload-side-criteria method limit (wing inertia relief not in the
  selection criterion) is recorded beside it. Docs only; the GUI-caption half stays
  with #73.

### Fixed

- **A polyline typed from blank in the oracle GUI no longer crashes WINGGEOM (C210-7, Cessna 210 build review 2026-08-23, tier S, 2026-08-23).**
  The leading-/trailing-edge grid of a blank surface is an empty frame, and an empty
  frame's columns are object-typed, which the grid renders as *text* — so every corner
  typed from blank came back as strings, was stored as string tuples and the Geometry
  page died on `ytip - yroot` (`TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and
  'str'`). The curve frame is now built numeric (`dtype=float`) even with no rows, and a
  cell that still arrives as text is parsed on the way in, never stored
  (`oracle_app/form.py` `render_curve` / `_numeric`). Found by the owner typing the 210
  wing; the beta review never saw it because its replays handed the renderer floats.
  Guard: `tests/test_dirty_flag.py::test_a_curve_typed_from_blank_is_numeric`.

- **Grid edits no longer vanish at typing pace in the oracle GUI (C210-4, build review 2026-08-23, tier S, 2026-08-23).**
  Every committed cell rebuilt the grid's input frame from the model, which changed
  `st.data_editor`'s widget identity (it includes the data bytes), which remounted the
  grid on the frontend — and any keystroke in flight when the remount landed was
  silently discarded (the write-back anti-pattern). At a normal typing rhythm roughly
  every other cell was lost, which made the 21-row Cessna 210 items table "impossible
  to enter" (owner); the same race turned a typed `-25` into `25` (the minus opened
  the cell editor, the remount reset it, the digits landed in a fresh overlay) and
  made Enter appear to drop entries. The base frame each grid renders from is now
  **stable for the page visit** (`_stable_frame` / `_FRAME_CACHE_KEY`): edits live in
  the widget's own state and are persisted to the model each run (equality-guarded,
  so idempotent); the frame rebuilds on page change, row-count change, unit toggle
  and project load. Numeric columns also carry an explicit `NumberColumn` config.
  All three symptoms confirmed gone by the owner on the fixed build (first-attempt
  commits, Enter commits, typed negatives land).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-08-23

### Added

- **One input-field registry: where each field is edited, and where it came from (design note 32 step OG-C, tier M, 2026-08-19).**
  `sloads/field_registry.py` classifies all **323** input fields of `Project`
  with six columns — `path │ slice │ editing page │ origin │ quantity │ owner` —
  replacing the two separate tables OG-14 merged: OG-5's field-*origin* registry
  and the 2026-08-16 GUI review's field-*ownership* registry (GR-INPUT-2 /
  GR-GEOM-2 / GR-GEOM-4). **207 fields (64 %) are `ORIGINAL`** — an input of a
  named `.BAS` program, so the oracle GUI must offer it — and **116 (36 %) are
  `SLOADS`**, capability this replication added. Every row cites what settles its
  origin: the `.BAS` variable carried over at porting time (`SAAFT`, `DELTA`,
  `NG`, `D0..D4`, `ENGWT`, `TREAD`), the `PROGRAM_SPEC.md` line restating UG
  Table 2.2, or the sloads step that introduced the field (Step C5/D5/E1/G1/G4,
  F25-2, L-7, plan 09, decision D-25). Gate **G4** (`tests/test_field_registry.py`)
  asserts totality in both directions against a type-based walk of the schema, so
  a new field in `models/inputs.py` fails the build until it is classified — the
  classification is a decision, not a default. The registry also closes the
  review's duplicate-owner class: **18 quantities are stored on more than one
  field**, each with one declared owner (or an explicit external one — "engine
  count" is `len(Project.engines)`, "engine mass" the weight database), including
  all five instances the review found by hand plus a sixth,
  `speeds.shoulder_altitude_ft` against `speeds.mach_limit.shoulder_altitude_ft`.
  `docs/generate_data_dict.py` now takes its per-field owning page from the
  registry and its own `PAGE_OVERRIDES` table is deleted.

- **Engine thrust at the hub — the assembled model's first forward force** (issue
  #10, carved out of design note 21, tier M, 2026-08-17). One user-entered
  `EngineInput.thrust_lb` per engine becomes an axial `FORCE` at that engine's
  hub in every assembled **flight** balanced case, and on the LRA beam model's
  engine hub node — the node the skeleton has carried since R-9 and, until now,
  never had a load on. `fx = −T` at `prop_cg` (falling back to `engine_cg`, and
  a refusal naming the datum when neither exists); the thrust line is taken
  axial, so the P-6 incidence/toe angles, the propeller normal force, the
  slipstream band and every DATCOM power derivative stay parked with note 21.
  **Nothing balances it, by design:** the V-n point the case is assembled at is
  thrust-free, so the applied thrust and its couple `−T·(z_hub − z_cg)` are the
  pre-closure `Fx` and `My` in full and are reacted by the closure —
  `n_x = (D − ΣT)/W`, the longitudinal carrier the assembled model has always
  lacked, and `q̇`. A powered case therefore joins the lateral, 23.427(a) and
  ground families in standing outside the 1 % pre-closure gate, with a stronger
  gate of its own: the residual *is* the thrust, in closed form. Ground cases
  state the entered value and do not apply it (rating thrust per case family is
  note 21's parked power-policy table), and an **asymmetric** entry is stated
  rather than handled — it yaws the airplane, mints no twin of its own (an axial
  force off the centreline makes neither the lateral force nor the roll that
  `is_handed` measures), and a twin got from another source mirrors the
  installation with everything else, which is note 21 §4.4's parked decision. New `tests/test_hub_thrust.py` gates
  G-1…G-11, including `ΣT = D ⇒ n_x = 0`, the hub node's exactly-zero transfer
  couple, and the six-DOF closure read back from the deck's own cards. Single
  owner `balance.hub_thrust_set` (`CONVENTIONS.md` §7); behaviour of record
  `docs/20_theory/balanced_cases.md` §2.1. The Engine Mount page gains the input,
  and `units.py` gains a `force` input kind (lbf → N — deliberately not the
  `weight` kind). **Off unless entered:** the schema field shipped with v54 and
  no fixture uses it, so every shipped number is bit-for-bit unchanged. Plan
  11's double-count authority table, `PROGRAM_SPEC`'s LRA-deck node list, note
  21's decision **P-6a**, the index and the parked entry all carried "the hub
  thrust `FORCE` is absent until power effects ship" and are corrected to what
  now ships: the hub `FORCE` is applied and **axial**, the mount node's
  ENGLOADS torque/gyro `MOMENT`s are still absent.

- **Lateral body aero in sideslip — wing-body `Cy_β`/`Cn_β` beside the fin (L-7, design note 19 rev. 3, issue #8, tier L, 2026-08-17, schema v54).**
  New `sloads/lateral_body_aero.py`: USAF DATCOM 5.2.1.1 / 5.2.3.1 (with the 4.2.1.1 body lift slope) transcribed from the Digital DATCOM Fortran including its digitised charts and its interpolators' end rules, **oracle-locked to DATCOM's printed sample output** (`ex1`, `ex3` M 0.6/0.8, `ex4`, `ex5`; ±0.1 %, every value within 0.05 %). New `sloads/atmosphere.py` (Sutherland viscosity + Reynolds number on TAS; `constants.standard_temperature_f` is the lapse-rate owner). `select` publishes each v-tail condition's sideslip `beta_deg` (SC-1) and the fin's own `cy_beta_fin`/`cn_beta_fin` about `xw`; `balance` applies **one** `body-aero` load (side force at the body side-area centroid, free couple closing `Cn_β` about `xw`) when `aero_coeffs.lateral_body_aero.enabled` — **off by default**, since it raises `|n_y|` and lowers `|ψ̈|` — and every lateral case states one of two sentences (the estimated term it does not carry, or the applied numbers) plus the fin + body `Cn_β` static-stability verdict, flagged when not restoring. Measured, term on vs off: RJ `|n_y|` +11 / +11 / +33 %, `|ψ̈|` −73 / −71 % / reversed (`YAW 15 NEUTRAL` / `SIDE GUST` / `YAW TO SIDESLIP`); ga6 `|n_y|` +27 / +27 % / ×2.9, `|ψ̈|` −41 / −40 % / reversed; both fixtures directionally stable (net −0.00154 / −0.00107 per deg). Munk's couple gets one owner (`fuselage_moment.munk_slope_per_rad`, L-7.7) and its yaw form is the G7 cross-check. Schema v54: `AeroCoefficientsInput.lateral_body_aero` (`LateralBodyAeroInput`, computed per case unless entered) and its passenger `EngineInput.thrust_lb` (reserved for #10, L-7.10); `CriticalCondition` gains the three published fields, `BalancedCaseResult` gains `body_side_force`/`body_yaw_moment`/`beta_deg`/`cn_beta_net`. Aero Coefficients page gains the sibling block. **Imperial digest wave** (`sbeam/balanced_deck`, `txt/balance` on the five fixtures with lateral cases — the standing L-7 note reworded and the per-case sentence added; no number moved with the term off, G8).

- **The oracle GUI computes: results, CSV and text on all fourteen pages (design note 32 step OG-E, tier M, 2026-08-20).**
  Every oracle page now runs its programs and shows what they produce, from one
  renderer — `oracle_app/results.py`, ~250 lines, no per-page output code. A
  page's programs come from `workflow.step_modules()`: the step's own `module`
  plus the contributors folded into it, which together are exactly what its
  `bas` string claims, so **Weight & Mass Properties runs all three of
  WTESTIMA+WTONECG+WTENV** and Wing Loads runs AIRLOADS, WINGINER and NETLOADS
  because `workflow.py` says so, not because the GUI names them.
  **Every file comes from an owner** (OG-6): load cases through
  `sloads.io.load_cases_csv` with `report.csv_comment_block`, the text report
  through `report.module_text_report` — the same two calls `cli.py` makes, so
  the ULT marker and the per-case SF statement are identical by construction.
  **The station tables come too.** AIRLOADS, NETLOADS and TAILDIST *print* a
  spanwise/chordwise table — it is what Appendix A is — and it lives in no
  `ModuleResult`. OG-6 is amended to name a third owner, `app_shell.limit_csv`,
  which OG-B had already extracted for exactly this channel. Those tables are
  LIMIT, the `CONVENTIONS.md` §3 analysis-page carve-out, and say so in-band
  and in a `*_LIMIT.csv` filename.
  A page whose upstream slices are missing says which ones; a program that
  cannot run says why (the error contract's `MissingInputError`/`ValueError`,
  caught as *not ready yet*, never as a blank table); and Aerodynamic Data —
  the one oracle page with no `.BAS` of its own — shows no results heading at
  all rather than an empty one.

- **The oracle GUI: a second front-end over the one analysis model (design note 32 step OG-D, tier M, 2026-08-20).**
  `streamlit run oracle_app/Oracle.py`, or the new `sloads-oracle` console
  script, opens a Streamlit app that exposes **only** what the original McMaster
  FAR 23 LOADS suite asked for: **230 input fields across 14 pages**, against the
  323 the full app carries. It is not a mode of `app/` — the two are peer
  front-ends over the same `sloads` calc package, sharing the project, the dirty
  guard, the units toggle and the unit-input boundary through `app_shell/` and
  nothing else. A project moves between them in both directions unchanged; this
  one asks for less, it stores nothing different.
  **Fourteen pages, one renderer, no page files.** `oracle_app/form.py` builds
  any page from `sloads.field_registry`: the page *is* the registry rows whose
  editing page is that step and whose path is in the oracle input set, and each
  widget's shape comes from the resolved annotation (`field_registry.field_type`,
  new), its unit from `units.field_unit` (new) through the shell's
  `unit_number_input`, and its help from the row's `basis` — so every field in
  this GUI can name the `.BAS` program that asked for it. Numbers, text,
  checkboxes, enum selects, `(X, Z)` gear points, `(X, Y, Z)` vectors, the
  five-term aero polynomials, the WINGGEOM planform polylines, spanwise curves
  and the mass-item tables are all derived rather than hand-written; the one
  hand-declared thing is the member labels for composite fields (an `XYPoint` is
  (X, Z) on a gear leg and (X, Y) on a planform, and no type can say which),
  which a guard requires for every composite in the input set.
  Navigation comes from `workflow.oracle_steps()` and the pages are callables
  rather than `views/<key>.py` files, so gate **G2** holds literally: adding a
  `bas` to a workflow step adds a page with no edit to the GUI at all. `Tail
  Loads` correctly has no input of its own and says so — TAILDIST/BALLOADS read
  entirely upstream.

- **Gate G5: the oracle GUI's reduced input set is run, not asserted (design note 32 step OG-C2, tier M, 2026-08-19).**
  `tests/test_oracle_inputs.py` builds the project the second front-end would
  produce — `sloads.field_registry.reduce_to_oracle_inputs`, every field outside
  its input set returned to its declared default — and checks it three ways: the
  same oracle-page modules run (or refuse, as `one_engine_out` correctly does on
  a single-engine airplane), every load value agrees with the full project
  within **±0.1 %**, and four Appendix A figures are restated directly on the
  reduced project (p136 IXX/IYY/IZZ, p141 wing AREA/MAC/XLE(MAC), p142 aileron,
  WTENV's 78 lb aft-gross ballast). Five of the six shipped examples reduce
  **exactly**; `concept_regional_jet` is excused in the file with its reason (the
  25.335(b) Mach-margin dive-speed route and turbofan engine data have no
  counterpart in the original suite), and a guard fails if a new example is
  neither. The one quantity the reduction drops — `root_torsion_myy_lra`, torsion
  about the loads reference axis — is declared with the reason it is sloads-only
  output rather than a lost oracle. Because every ga6-based Appendix A oracle
  test asserts against the *full* project, agreement carries all of them onto the
  reduced set without restating a figure.

- **Workflow command crib sheet** (`docs/10_standard/WORKFLOW_COMMANDS.txt`,
  tier S, 2026-08-22): copy-paste command sequences for a release under the
  solo profile — opening the `dev/vX.Y.Z` milestone branch, closing each item
  on it with `solo_close.sh`, cutting the release on that branch and landing
  the milestone on `main` as one merge-commit pull request, and the recoveries
  (a mid-sequence script stop, a moved remote, the one out-of-band hotfix). A
  plain-text summary of `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0, which stays the authority.
  (First written for the branch → PR → squash-merge loop and rewritten later
  the same day, when that loop was replaced — see the milestone-branch entry.)

### Changed

- **The app-layer shell has one owner: `app_shell/` (design note 32 step OG-B, tier L, 2026-08-19).**
  The Streamlit code shared by every sloads front-end moves out of `app/` into a
  new installed package: `app_shell/components.py` (page scaffold, the
  `unit_number_input` unit boundary, workflow page links, the FAR 23
  applicability banner), `app_shell/project_state.py` (the project in session
  state, the saved-snapshot baseline and the dirty/discard/load guard),
  `app_shell/sidebar.py` (the global units toggle and project
  Open/Save/upload/download widget) and `app_shell/limit_csv.py` (the analysis
  pages' LIMIT tables and downloads). `app/Home.py` keeps only what is specific
  to that front-end — its page set, its sidebar grouping and its single
  `st.set_page_config` — and drops from 258 lines to 81. No behaviour changes:
  the same widgets render in the same order with the same keys, and every
  extracted function is the one that was there, minus its leading underscore.
  **Gate G8** is new, in `tests/test_app_shell.py`: no GUI package may redefine
  a name the shell owns, the shell may not import a GUI package back, and the
  GUI set is *derived* (a directory holding a `set_page_config` entry point)
  rather than listed, so a second front-end is covered on arrival instead of
  needing the guard rewritten. `app_shell` is a real installed package
  (`pyproject.toml` `packages.find`), not a directory on Streamlit's implicit
  entrypoint path — which is what lets a second entry point import it without
  inheriting the first one's `sys.path`, and which retires the
  `sys.path.insert(…, "app")` hack in `conftest.py` and eight test modules.
  **One-time developer step: re-run `pip install -e '.[dev]'`**, and restart any
  running `streamlit run app/Home.py` — an interpreter started before this
  change resolves the old package set and will raise `ModuleNotFoundError: No
  module named 'app_shell'`.

- **0.7.0 re-scoped as a beta release of the oracle GUI — the 2026-08-22
  backlog re-cut** (tier S, 2026-08-22,
  `docs/50_reviews/2026-08-22_backlog_review_0_7_0_beta.md`, BB-1…BB-10): band
  A repopulated with #51 (the unkeyed half of `app/views/`; #50 closed as its
  duplicate) landing as one pass with #44 (the unit-boundary rollout, pulled
  forward — the fixes share their call sites), #45 promoted on a measurement
  (2 of 14 oracle pages give a fresh project wrong "run the pages before this
  one first" guidance for a slice their own form enters), and #52 pulled
  forward with a **v55 schema hop** retiring both duplicate entries (both
  pairs render side by side on one oracle page each), plus a **pre-cut beta
  review** of the oracle GUI's function end-to-end (user; the 2026-08-15
  candidate-review pattern), last, so the cut waits for it; the `app/views/`
  freeze lifts for exactly #51/#44's call sites and the schema freeze for
  exactly #52's hop; nothing promoted from `02_parked.md`.

- **Backlog re-cut for 0.7.0 after the 0.6.0 cut (issue #30, review `2026-08-17_backlog_review_0_7_0.md` BR-1…BR-13, tier S, 2026-08-17).**
  Band A is the 0.7.0 scope, measured against `CLAUDE.md` rule 6: the
  fixture-data pass first (#9 — it carries the `ga6_normal` body outline the
  headline needs and closes the WTENV-envelope defect), **L-7 lateral body aero
  as the headline** (#8 — `ψ̈` over-stated 73–84 %, `n_y` under-stated 4–12 %,
  a Digital DATCOM printed oracle; note 19 to be agreed in chat first; the one
  0.7.0 schema hop), the hub thrust card (#10), the combined station envelope
  (#11), the recorded decisions (#13, with the gust-shape study #12 **merged**
  in — reusing Schrenk is inside the Schrenk band by construction), and the
  **GUI review** (#29) the user asked for, which re-opens the UI freeze to the
  extent its findings justify. Band B = the aileron increment (#14); band C
  unchanged; nothing promoted from `02_parked.md`. Stale 0.6.0 prose replaced;
  note 12 (CONM2) status corrected to shipped — its C6 gate has been in
  `test_sbeam_roundtrip.py` since the harness — so it rolls at the 0.7.0 cut.
  Closes #30.

- **The PR CI leg runs uninstrumented; coverage enforces on the push to
  `main`, under the sysmon core (process, tier S, 2026-08-22).** Coverage
  instrumentation on the 2-core runner had grown `test (3.12)` on a PR past
  27 minutes (vs ~2.5 uninstrumented local minutes); the 80 % floor is one
  number a PR almost never moves, so it now rides the merge push with the
  3.9/3.11 compatibility legs, fixed forward (`DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0).
  The instrumented leg measures with `COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon` (Python 3.12's
  `sys.monitoring`, near-zero overhead), which is line-only below 3.14 —
  `branch = true` leaves `[tool.coverage.run]`; branch figures remain
  available locally with `--cov-branch`.

- **The two quantities that were entered twice are entered once (schema v55;
  note 33 §8 / DS-7, issue #52, tier L, 2026-08-22).** `MachLimitInput` no
  longer stores a shoulder altitude — `speeds.shoulder_altitude_ft` is its one
  home and `mach_limit_lines(inp, mc, md, shoulder_altitude_ft)` takes it as an
  argument beside MC/MD, so the Mach-limit table's first row and the Mach
  numbers on it are at the same altitude by construction. SELECT's airplane
  length LF is one field, `geometry.empennage.airplane_length_in`
  (`derived_geometry.airplane_length_in`), read by both the 23.423(b) pitch
  inertia and the default IZZ; the per-tail copies are gone. Migration hop
  `54` reconciles a legacy file's pairs — the value that governed the shipped
  output wins (the MACHLIM altitude; the htail length), a zero/absent copy
  loses silently, and a real disagreement raises a warning naming both numbers,
  which the GUIs show as a toast on load (`app_shell.project_state.safe_load`)
  and the CLI on stderr. Each oracle page now renders one widget per quantity
  (DG-5 completed; `STILL_DUPLICATED` shrank to the two class-B overrides).
  Both `app/views/` pages lost their second widget (the freeze's one hop). No
  oracle moved: every shipped example agrees on both pairs and is folded in
  silently at load (examples stay on disk at their original version, as
  `test_cg_cases.py` requires).

- **Fixture CG datum reconciled and the flight cases pinned to the WTENV limits (D-27; the remainder of the fixture-data pass, issue #9, tier L, 2026-08-17).**
  Root cause found and closed: the four type fixtures' fuselage-carried item
  stations were hand-entered (2026-07-15) on a datum ~20–65 in aft of the wing
  polyline's, so every D-26 CG case — not only the all-up loading — sat 15–25 in
  aft of the entered `%MAC` aft limit, at 51–65 % MAC. Item stations are the
  less authoritative input (D-27a): the fuselage-carried rows shift onto the wing
  datum so the empty CG sits at a type-plausible %MAC (C210 18, ATR-42/Dash 8 25,
  RJ 35); wing-tied and tail rows do not move; the C210 nose group and the RJ's
  engines/gear/crew are held by hand and the RJ's cabin/holds re-spaced. The
  cases turn round with them: **a FLIGHT case is now a WTENV structural-limit
  point by construction** — new `cg_cases.seed_flight_cases` (aft gross, fwd
  gross, fwd regardless, min weight + `mid gross`), loading derived under D-25d's
  10 % gate (0–8.5 % solved ballast on every case), `zcg` the closing loading's
  own; the ground three re-seeded by `seed_landing_cases`; `mass.cases` and the
  legacy `flight_loads`/`landing` mirrors regenerated. On the Appendix A airplane
  the seed reproduces CG1..CG4 (85.1 / 77.49 / 72.64 / 73.09) — ga6 is untouched.
  New warning `mass_item_outside_body` (a fuselage-carried row ahead of the
  outline's nose or behind its tail; fore/aft extent only) — the three-view's
  claim made structural; the ga6 outline's nose moves to FS −12 (spinner tip:
  Appendix A's propeller sits at −10) so its Appendix A rows are inside it.
  Guards: `tests/test_cg_cases.py` (fixture cases *are* the seeds; every case
  inside its envelope; every fuselage item inside the outline; the ga6
  reproduction). Re-pinned by design (`test_balance.py` and friends): the closure
  `Izz`, the lateral cases, the unsymmetrical split, the `dCD` bands, the
  residual ratchets (worst symmetric force residual now `atr42` 2.36 % at the
  aft-gross point — under the 2.5 % hard stop, same lift-model reading, heavier
  case; RJ down to 0.48 % unclamped), the ATR PHAA speed (185.36 kt) and its
  25,000 ft stall exceedance (9 points, +0.27), the RJ fin roll arm. Digest wave:
  35–37 channels on each of the four fixtures; `ga6_normal` only the four
  outline-nose channels (h-tail attachment / LRA / balanced deck / tail text —
  balance CSV unmoved); `concept_heavy` untouched. WTENV's degenerate-marker
  tests rebuilt on synthetic databases (the RJ no longer exhibits them). Closes
  the WTENV-envelope defect and #9.

- **Fixture-data pass: entered empennage planforms on the four type fixtures, the `ga6_normal` fin root pinned and its Appendix A body outline entered (issue #9, Pri 1, tier M, 2026-08-17).**
  Three fixture edits, each with its own attributable digest wave, in note 19
  §10.2's order. **(i)** `ga6_normal` enters `vtail_root_waterline_z = 78.5` —
  the value the fuselage-top fallback had been producing (wing root waterline
  + `fuselage_height 0 / 2`), now stated: zero numeric movement, only the
  `ASSUMED … fuselage-top` provenance notes on the fin cards/report become
  `entered`. **(ii)** `cessna_210`, `atr42_100`, `dhc8_dash8` and
  `concept_regional_jet` enter `htail`/`vtail` polylines — taper 0.4–0.7,
  LE sweep 6–30° (h-tail 6–28°, fins 30–35°), estimated from the type
  three-views, tied to the scalar area/span/`xt25`/`xv25` and reported with
  `elements = wing.elements // 2` (the derived rectangle's count, so the
  station set does not change shape). Every tail card, tail CSV, balance text,
  balanced deck and LRA deck on those four moves; the fin LOAD and `n_y` are
  bit-identical (see the `fixed` fragment) while `p_dot` falls 6–10 % (a
  tapered fin's load centroid sits lower, so its roll arm shrinks) and `r_dot`
  moves < 1 %. `ga6_normal` deliberately stays on the derived rectangle:
  Appendix A prints no tail chords, and an invented taper on the oracle
  fixture would be reported as entered data. Fin sweeps were capped at 30° on
  the three larger types because ≥ 35° pushes the SI (mm-frame) LRA deck over
  sbeam's dense-path 1e15 condition heuristic — the known units-artifact
  limitation the RJ's SI deck already xfails on. **(iii)** `ga6_normal` gains
  the Appendix A body outline (Ref 1 p.49 airplane data): length 26.522 ft,
  max width 3.833 ft, height 68.7 in from the printed 17.231 sq ft frontal
  area read as an ellipse (the `FuselageSection` area rule), on the suite's
  three-section pattern (max at 0.35 L; tail cone 0.10 w / 0.15 h), `z_centre`
  left unentered. It moves ga6's h-tail attachment from the innermost strip
  pair to the outline's half-width at the h-tail LRA station (±7.5 in), gives
  the wing stick deck an SOB node and the report a side-of-body table, and
  lets the LRA beam model build for the Appendix A airplane for the first
  time (`sbeam/lra_model` joins its digest set); the balance CSV and every
  Appendix A oracle are untouched. Reference: note 19 §10.2, plan 09 T-1/T-8a.
  Closes the planform and outline parts of #9; the WTENV-envelope part stays
  open with a re-stated body (see the backlog).

- **The solo loop is one milestone branch per release, not one branch and one PR
  per item (`DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0, tier M, 2026-08-22).**
  `scripts/solo_start.sh dev/vX.Y.Z` opens a single branch off `main` for a
  release; every item of that milestone is worked and committed directly on it
  by `scripts/solo_close.sh --slug <slug> [<issue>] "<Subject>"` — one commit
  per closed item, with the item's issue closed and its priority-table row
  removed *in that commit*, so the backlog stays a live view of what is still
  open mid-milestone. The release is then cut on the same branch
  (`RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §4 — there is no separate `release/x.y.z` while solo)
  and reaches `main` as **one** pull request merged with a **merge commit**, so
  every per-item commit survives and `git log` stays the step-per-commit record.
  The defect class this closes is two closing paths both claiming to close the
  item: #38 mixed a hand-made PR with `solo_close.sh`, and the PR body's
  `Closes #38` closed the issue before the script's own `gh issue close` ran;
  #53/#54 committed to a branch whose PR had already squash-merged; and the
  `--ff-only` push needed an admin bypass because `main` requires a PR. With one
  path, `main`'s branch protection stays fully on and no bypass is used.
  `solo_close.sh` no longer checks out, fast-forwards or pushes `main`, no
  longer deletes a branch, and no longer has a close-on-`main` docs-only path
  (the docs-only predicate now sizes the gate and nothing else); `--slug` became
  required, since the branch names the milestone rather than the item.
- **CI runs the fast gate on `dev/**` and reserves the full matrix for the merge
  to `main` (tier M, 2026-08-22).** Pushes to a milestone branch run one
  interpreter (3.12 uninstrumented), `mypy` and the 3.12 solver round-trip —
  measured 7.3 min — as an **advisory** signal: `dev/**` is unprotected, nothing
  waits on it, and it runs while the next item is already being worked. The
  3.9/3.11 compatibility legs and the coverage-instrumented 3.12 leg run on the
  push to `main`, which under this model is the milestone merge. The three
  matrix conditionals now key on *push to `main`* rather than on "is this a pull
  request" — keyed the old way, a `dev/**` push would have taken the other arm
  and run the ~27-minute instrumented matrix on every item.
- **The design-note issue template asked for a label that does not exist (tier S,
  2026-08-22).** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/design-note.md` requested `kind:note`,
  which was never created — `gh` refuses the whole `issue create` on an unknown
  label, so every design note opened from the template failed or lost its kind.
  Found while filing this item's own issue. The template now asks for
  `kind:decision`, which exists and is what a design note records, and
  `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §4's label enumeration was corrected to the live set
  (it listed `kind:note` too, and omitted `kind:decision`).

- **No combined flight + ground station envelope — decided against permanently, not deferred**
  (decision **D-28**, issue #11 closed as decided, tier M, 2026-08-18). The
  follow-on decision **G-9** filed in step 10 — two-sided max/min per station
  over both families with each extreme naming its governing case — will not be
  built. On the **fuselage** the two families are assessed with *different
  internal-pressure companion cases*, so a station extreme from one and a
  station extreme from the other belong to different total load states: a
  pointwise `max()` over both would present a number that no single design
  condition produces. sloads excludes pressurization permanently (**D-24**), so
  it cannot form the correct combined state from its own outputs at all — the
  combination is unsupportable here, not merely less useful. This reinstates, on
  its own merits, the "for pressurized airplanes ground cases cannot be
  down-selected against flight" rule that D-24 recorded as leaving with the
  pressurization scope. The **wing and empennage** carry no such companion, but
  the deliverable stays per family uniformly — one rule, not a per-component
  exception. **What the user gets is unchanged and unreduced:** each family's own
  critical set as today — SELECT's governing conditions for flight, LANDLOAD's
  six per-FAR critical-reaction summaries plus the 33-case matrix and the
  assembled ground decks for ground — and combining them stays the consumer's
  act, performed with their own pressure cases in hand. The
  `ground-flight-separate-families` standing limitation now carries that reason
  in every report and deck header, beside the `pressurization` exclusion it
  depends on; G-9's original safety-factor argument is deliberately **not**
  restated, having been retracted by **G-10** (both families are limit × 1.5).
  The ground family's genuinely missing piece — no per-station distributed view
  at all, `body_loads`/`net_loads` being flight-only — is filed as **#31**
  (band B), where it stays a *per-family* deliverable. Swept in passing (rule 4,
  the stale-index class #10 corrected the day before): `docs/00_INDEX.md` still
  described design note 19 as "Revision 2 … PROPOSED — not agreed, no code"
  after L-7 shipped on 2026-08-17 — corrected to SHIPPED at revision 3 with its
  implementation named. No calc, no oracle and no shipped load number moves.

- **Design note 32 (oracle GUI) agreed; the GUI freeze lifted for its work (tier S, 2026-08-19).**
  `docs/30_future/32_oracle_gui_note.md` moves `PROPOSED` → `AGREED`, making the
  oracle GUI the next development phase and unblocking step OG-B (tier L, so
  `CLAUDE.md` rule 1 gated it on the note being agreed — the note's status, not
  the freeze, was what actually held step one). §8 records the freeze decision in
  place of the request for one, including what it defers: the 2026-08-16 GUI
  review's placement batch for `app/`, except the two findings that outrank it
  under rule 6 as defects in shipped behaviour rather than placement — the gear
  reference point having no widget, and `speeds.wing_area_sqft` being an input
  nothing reads. One decision was added at agreement: **OG-14**, one registry
  rather than two — OG-5's field-*origin* registry and the GUI review's
  field-*ownership* registry (GR-INPUT-2) are the same table under two names, so
  step OG-C now builds a single `field path │ owning slice │ editing page │
  origin` registry with one drift guard, closing gates G4/G5 and the review's
  duplicate-owner class together. OG-5 and OG-C are amended to match.

- **A cross-page link names a step, not a path; one `set_page_config` per GUI (design note 32 step OG-F, tier M, 2026-08-20).**
  `app_shell.components.workflow_page_link` built its target as
  `views/<key>.py` — true of `app/` and of nothing else, and the last
  front-end-shaped fact left inside the shell OG-B extracted so neither GUI
  would carry the other's assumptions. It now resolves a step key to the running
  GUI's own `st.Page` object through the new **`app_shell/nav.py`**: each entry
  point registers the page set it hands `st.navigation`, and a link therefore
  cannot name a page that GUI does not carry. A step outside the running page
  set degrades to plain text, as it already did when a path would not resolve.
  **OG-10** is restated — the rule was "only `Home.py` calls
  `st.set_page_config`", which names a file rather than a role and says nothing
  about a second front-end. It is now **exactly one call per GUI entry point,
  exactly one entry point per GUI, and none in a view or in the shell**, stated
  in `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` §5 and `CLAUDE.md` and guarded in
  `tests/test_app_shell.py`. The shell case is the one the old wording could not
  express: `app_shell/` is imported by both GUIs, so a `set_page_config` there
  would be the first Streamlit call of whichever one ran.
  `tests/test_page_links.py` stays `app/`-scoped and now says why (see the
  history entry): OG-9's parametrization of it is withdrawn.

- **`FOLDED_MODULES` names the step that runs each folded program (design note 32 step OG-E, tier M, 2026-08-20).**
  `sloads.workflow.FOLDED_MODULES` was a flat tuple of the calc modules with no
  page of their own; the owning step was in the comment above it and nowhere
  else. It is now a `module → owning step key` mapping, with
  `workflow.step_modules(key)` returning a page's programs primary-first. A page
  headed "WTESTIMA+WTONECG+WTENV" has to be able to run all three, and a tuple
  cannot say which page WTESTIMA belongs to. Membership reads (`name in
  FOLDED_MODULES`, `set(FOLDED_MODULES)`) are unaffected — they read the keys —
  and three guards in `tests/test_workflow.py` now hold the mapping to a
  partition: every folded module is registered, names a real step, is not also
  that step's primary, and every registered module runs on exactly one page.

- **The lint gate covers every GUI, and every statement of it must agree (design note 32 step OG-D, tier M, 2026-08-20).**
  `oracle_app/` and `oracle.py` join the ruff target list — which is written out
  in **eleven** places (CI, the pre-commit hook, `solo_close.sh`, four standard
  docs, the PR template, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` and the script test that pins
  it). Adding `app_shell/` meant editing nine of them by hand; this is the
  second sweep, which is where `CLAUDE.md` rule 3 says a convention stops being
  a prose rule. Two guards in `tests/test_app_shell.py` now close it:
  every **derived** GUI directory (a repo-root directory holding a
  `set_page_config` entry point — the same discovery gate G8 uses) must appear
  in CI's lint command, and every file that repeats that command must repeat it
  **exactly**, with CI as the authority. A GUI outside the lint gate is unlinted
  code behind a green badge; a document stating a different gate is a developer
  running a different one from the PR that will fail.
  Also here, because the oracle GUI's generic renderer is what needed it:
  `units` gains a `moment` input kind (lb-in → N·m, distinct from the engine
  channel's `torque` in ft-lb) for the entered unbalanced wing moment, and
  `field_registry.field_at` is split so `field_type` can resolve a path's real
  annotation rather than the string `Field.type` holds under
  `from __future__ import annotations`.
  **`oracle_app` is an installed package**, so `pip install -e '.[dev]'` must be
  re-run once after this change or the entry point cannot import its own
  renderer.

- **Single-dev merge discipline recorded, and the backlog removal rule
  de-conflicted (process, tier S, 2026-08-22).** `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0
  now states the PR-mode rules while solo — one open PR at a time, sync on
  `origin/main` before opening, and a squash-merged branch is dead (never
  committed to again; the #53/#54 duplicate-history conflict is the evidence).
  `00_backlog.md`'s removal rule drops "renumber the remaining rows freely",
  which contradicted §0's no-renumbering row and was the priority table's
  standing merge-conflict source (87ebaf1's reconciliation merge being the
  prior instance); a closing change now deletes its own row and touches
  nothing else, with dense numbering returning only at a re-cut.
  *Superseded in part later in this cycle:* the PR-mode rules went with the
  per-item PR itself — one milestone branch replaced both, and the #53/#54
  evidence is now recorded there as the reason. The row-removal rule stands
  unchanged and is what lets the priority table close items mid-milestone.

- **Pre-cut beta review — the oracle GUI's function end-to-end** (issue #61,
  tier S, 2026-08-22, `docs/50_reviews/2026-08-22_pre_cut_beta_review.md`,
  PB-1…PB-24): the fresh-project journey driven on all 14 oracle pages
  (`ga6_normal` and `dhc8_dash8` typed from blank through the pages' own
  widgets, results and downloads compared byte-for-byte with the loaded
  examples, save → reload → re-run a fixed point), the `oracle_app/` +
  `app_shell/` delta since `4b1ddcc` read adversarially, and gates G1–G8
  re-checked for rot. **The cut waits:** eight findings block it — the oracle
  GUI's project is not the project gate G5 tests (`Project.mass` never
  produced, so One Engine Out is a dead end on a twin and Configuration's
  tip-back uses a 25 %-MAC estimate; every weight item untagged, the wing
  panel on the fuselage beam at 9 % of peak BODYLOAD shear, unmarked; the
  reduction keeping the result slices and rotor rows it claims to drop, −16 %
  twin mount torque unseen); selector and code fields as blank free text
  (duplicate CG-case names flip TAILDIST loads, `category` "u" falls through
  to Normal); an engine layout that saves a file the loader refuses; the
  sidebar's *Download project.json* one edit stale; and no project name in
  this GUI, so every save overwrites `project.project.json`. Sixteen
  known-issues (the literal `wing` name, four rotted gates, the migration
  notice that never fires, page-order dependencies, the unit radio, masked
  errors, un-clearable overrides, presentation, note-32 drift) filed for the
  release notes. No code changed in the review.

- **Three long-open questions recorded as decisions, not carried as work** (decisions
  **D-29**/**D-30**/**D-31**, issue #13, tier S, 2026-08-18; #12 merged in at the 0.7.0
  re-cut, review BR-6). Each was pinned by a test and described in the backlog as an
  open defect; none was, and the bodies leave the *Open defects* index under the
  removal rule while both pins stay.
  **D-29 — the derived `ACRL` point.** With `wing_mass.cases` empty the derived wing
  case names SELECT's own 23.349(a)(2) pick (CL ≈ 1.30 at 117.4 kt), which differs
  ~19 % from the worked example's entered point (CL 1.55 at 116 kt, Ref 1 p217-221) and
  carries `unbal_moment = 0`. Accepted and stated rather than reconciled: there is no
  printed oracle for the derived route and every shipped fixture enters its cases
  explicitly, so no oracle or deliverable is affected. The consequence is now stated
  where the route is offered — the derived route is a **first pass**, and an `ACRL`
  case used for sizing is entered, never derived.
  **D-30 — the ATR-42's Mach-capped points.** The nine points at 25,000 ft that sit
  above the Mach-adjusted stall CL are **ordinary stall/Mach-limited flight, not a
  defect**: an airplane commonly cannot reach its manoeuvre load factor at altitude, and
  the regulation says so — **23.333(b)**'s manoeuvring envelope applies "*except where
  limited by maximum (static) lift coefficients*" (Ref 1 p62; Ref 2 §11.2.1.2 p68), so
  these points lie **outside** the envelope the rule defines rather than being design
  conditions the airplane fails to reach, and the Mach cap that produces them is
  **23.335** a.(4)'s own compressibility-limited MC at altitudes where an MD is
  established (Ref 2 §7.2.1 p45-46; here MC = 0.4555), design speeds being EAS otherwise.
  The point is nonetheless *not* re-reported at a reduced "attainable" load factor — on
  conservatism and method consistency, **not** on an obligation to design to n = 2.5
  there, which the rule does not impose — and the fixture is *not* edited to hide a true
  statement about a real airplane. This retires the previous framing that those
  loads are "not physically attainable": `nz = n` is enforced, so the load factor and
  the total `n·W` are exact and the entire effect is on the LZW/LT split. Measuring it
  (2026-08-18) found the real content — the balance closes at alpha 14.1–16.3 deg
  against a fitted stall edge of 13.18 deg, so CM and CD are extrapolated 0.9–3.1 deg
  past their fits, and frozen at the fit edge instead the published tail quantities move
  3.3–44 % (LT), 6.5–20.4 % (LT25/LT50), 8.5–20.8 % (elevator load) and 1.1–4.8 deg
  (elevator deflection), against a base-method band of 5–10 %. Above the bar, so it is
  ranked (rule 6) — but **0 of the 9 are SELECTed as a governing critical condition**,
  so no sizing case, critical-condition table or exported deck load moves anywhere. It
  is a published-number marking item: BALLOADS publishes all 300 V-n points, so nine
  published rows carry the extrapolation unmarked. Filed as **#32** (mark them — rows
  stay published and marked, never withheld, the marker derived at publication from the
  point's own CL against its Mach-adjusted stall CL, so no schema field) and **#33**
  (the solver's own silence: both iteration loops return their last iterate with no
  signal, swept across both loops per rule 4).
  **D-31 — gust spanwise shape.** The gust cases reuse the manoeuvre spanwise shape;
  the difference is inside the Schrenk band *by construction*, Schrenk being this
  method's own approximation of that shape, so it is recorded with the ±5–10 % that
  parks it (`docs/20_theory/00_theory_sources.md` §Base-method uncertainty) and
  re-opens only if the wing airload basis moves off Schrenk.
  Swept in passing (rule 4): removing the table's first row exposed a latent hole in
  `tests/test_backlog_issues.py::test_render_round_trips_the_live_table_and_drops_closed_rows`.
  `render_backlog` keys a row to its **first** `(#N)` — the one `row_from_issue` emits —
  so a later `(#N)` in the same line is a cross-reference and closing *that* issue must
  leave the row alone; the test instead expected every row line *mentioning* the closed
  issue to disappear. The two agreed only while the table led with an issue nothing else
  cited, and stopped agreeing the moment #29 led it and #17's row cites it. The test now
  encodes ownership, and asserts positively that a citing row survives with its text
  intact — the production behaviour was correct throughout, and no shipped table row
  changes.
  No calc, no oracle and no shipped load number moves; the two pinning tests keep their
  assertions and gain the decision each now pins.

- **The concept→FAR23 reduction is gated bit-for-bit, not at ±0.1 % (CR-B-2
  `[MAJOR]`, tier S, 2026-08-22).** `tests/test_concept.py`'s
  `_assert_modules_identical` compared float load values with
  `math.isclose(rel_tol=1e-3)` while its own docstring — and
  `theory_sources.md` — called the reduction *exact*. It is an identity, not an
  oracle comparison: concept mode differs from FAR23 mode at exactly one place
  (`maneuver_load_factors` returns the caller's `(n, n-)` instead of the 23.337
  cap), so feeding the FAR23 caps back through the concept branch re-runs the
  same arithmetic on the same floats. Anything the oracle tolerance absorbed
  would have been a *second* category-dependent branch hiding under 0.1 %, which
  is a finding to investigate rather than a rounding artefact. Now `==`, and it
  passes — no divergence exists today, so the gate is what keeps it that way.
  Swept in the same change (rule 4):
  `tests/test_oracle_inputs.py::test_the_reduced_project_reproduces_every_number`
  was the same defect class — dropping a field that is genuinely not an input
  must change nothing at all, and a value that moves by less than 0.1 % is
  precisely the misclassified registry row that gate exists to name. Also exact
  now, and also already passing; design note 32's ±0.1 % wording remains the
  floor this exceeds. `tests/test_taildist.py::test_airload4_reduction_invariant`
  was checked and was already exact; `test_speed_ratio_route_reproduces_todays_numbers_on_every_example`
  is *not* the class — its frozen pre-F25-2 literals are 6-decimal
  transcriptions, so `1e-6` is required there by construction.

- **Solo close loop: the issue is optional, the gate scales to the change set, docs close on `main` (tier M, 2026-08-19).**
  `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0 calls issues and branches *optional* under the solo
  profile, but `solo_start.sh` / `solo_close.sh` required both — an open GitHub
  issue and a `<type>/<slug>` branch — so the two mechanisms the profile
  switched off were mandatory in the tooling that implements it, at four `gh`
  round-trips per item. The issue number is now an optional positional on both
  scripts: omit it and neither calls `gh` at all (no auth check, no issue read,
  no `gh issue close`, no `backlog_issues.py check`); pass it and the old
  behaviour is unchanged. A **docs-only change set** — every path either `*.md`
  or under `docs/` or `changes/` — may be closed directly on `main` (`--slug`
  names the fragment) and skips the checkout, merge and branch delete, and its
  gate is `ruff` · `mypy` plus the five guard files §0 already names rather than
  the whole suite: ~3 s against ~150 s. Any path outside that allowlist takes a
  branch and the full suite; `--full-gate` forces the suite either way, and CI
  on the push to `main` is the gate as before. Re-measured while doing it and
  recorded in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, whose standing argument against a fast
  subset ("36 s, no test over 10 s", 2026-08-16) is now false in both halves:
  the suite is ~150 s, thirteen tests exceed 10 s, and the longest single test
  (~43 s) is a hard parallel floor no core count can beat. Guard:
  `tests/test_solo_scripts.py`.
  *Superseded in part later in this cycle:* the optional issue number and the
  change-set-scaled gate stand, but closing a docs-only set on `main` was
  removed with the branch-per-item loop — every item now closes the same way on
  the milestone branch (see the milestone-branch entry).

- **Unit-boundary rollout completed: `unit_number_input` everywhere**
  (CR-D-2, issue #44, tier M, 2026-08-22, one pass with #51): the seven
  remaining hand-paired views (`structural_speeds`, `weight_mass`,
  `aileron_loads`, `flap_loads`, `landing_loads`, `wing_loads`,
  `flight_envelope`'s SELECT inputs) moved their scalar `number_input`s onto
  the boundary helper — the `to_display`-seed / `to_imperial_scalar`-on-Apply
  idiom is gone from `app/views/`; the `data_editor` grids remain the one
  hand-converted surface. A no-op-Apply-in-SI bit-identity test per converted
  view (`tests/test_view_unit_roundtrip.py`) guards the untouched-field
  return path, and `GUI_design.md` §7/§11's rollout claim is now true.

### Fixed

- **Every keyed `max`/`min` pick in the package is platform-stable, and the guard
  that says so now reads the AST (review 2026-08-20 CR-B-1, tier M, 2026-08-22).**
  `CONVENTIONS.md` §7 claimed that every keyed critical-case pick went through
  `select._extreme` — first-in-order inside a `TIE_REL` relative band, so two
  candidates that tie in exact arithmetic cannot select different cases on
  different platforms. The claim was false at the worked example itself: the
  23.423(a) unchecked-manoeuvre pick over the `BAL A` points was a raw
  `(min if want_min else max)(bal_a, key=…)`, and the guard was a substring grep
  for a line containing `max(`/`min(` **and** `key=` — a construction containing
  neither, so the guard passed over a live bypass.
  The tie rule is now `sloads/picks.py::extreme`, a public single owner (it was
  private to one module while the convention it enforces is repo-wide), and the
  guard is `tests/test_platform_stability.py::test_every_keyed_pick_in_sloads_goes_through_picks_extreme`
  — an AST walk over the whole package for a built-in `min`/`max` call carrying a
  `key=` argument, matched on the callee expression so the conditional form, an
  alias, and a call spread over several lines all read the same.
  Rule 4 swept the class rather than the instance: **fourteen** call sites were
  converted, in `select`, `landing` (the gear family whose own docstring records
  that cases 19-22 share a VMP), `one_engine_out`, `weight_envelope`, `aileron`,
  `tail_span`, `rigid_body` (the Gaussian pivot row), `validation`, and the
  exporters `equilibrium`, `sbeam_bridge`, `mass_cards`, `lra_import` and
  `lra_model` — where equidistant nodes are the rule on a symmetric airplane, not
  the exception, and the pick decides which node carries a load. Four of those
  the old grep could not have seen either: they are multi-line calls. Nearest-node
  selection gained one owner (`lra_model.nearest_node`) instead of three copies.
  No delivered number moves: the whole suite, the oracles and the frozen Imperial
  digest are unchanged — `extreme` returns first-in-order, which is exactly what
  `max`/`min` already return for a bit-exact tie. §7's wording was narrowed to the
  shape the guard actually enforces, and states that a pick written as an
  accumulation loop is outside any static walk.

- **#51's residual scope filed, and the prose that overstated the shipped fix
  corrected (tier S, 2026-08-22).** The 2026-08-21 closure review of #51 found
  the project-generation stamp covers the *keyed* widgets only: 98
  project-seeded widgets in `app/views/` carry no `key=`, an unkeyed widget's
  Streamlit identity derives from its arguments (not per-render, as the guard
  assumed), and the stale-edit-survives-a-load defect still reproduces there.
  #51 is reopened with the full scope in its 2026-08-22 comment and a band-B
  backlog row (10a) riding the #44 unit-boundary rollout. Corrected in the
  same pass: the `widget_keys.py` / `project_state.adopt` docstrings now name
  both generation-bump sites (the JSON editor's Apply is the second), and
  parked L-8d's residual reads unkeyed-replacement *and* mutation, not
  mutation only.

- **Apply no longer deletes what the form does not render — the landing gear is
  reachable, and four pages stopped silently discarding stated values (#36 part 1,
  review 2026-08-20 CR-A-2 neighbourhood, tier M, 2026-08-21).** A form that
  rebuilds an input dataclass from its own widgets resets every field it forgot to
  name, so pressing **Apply** — with nothing typed — erased data a hand-written
  `project.json` had supplied. The landing-gear form was the worst case and the
  one the backlog names: it dropped `carrier` (decision G-2), `attach` (the G-12
  trunnion node) and `weight_lb` (G-12a), the three fields the sbeam ground model
  needs, so a GUI-built project exported **zero gear nodes** — and because the
  form never rendered them, re-entering them was impossible. All three now have
  widgets, with a **"— not stated —"** carrier option so G-2's deliberate absence
  survives a round trip instead of being guessed. The same defect, swept in the
  same change: the empennage form dropped the fin root waterline (B8a-1) so the
  fin quietly re-derived onto the centreline as a *marked assumption*; the engine
  form dropped `mounted_on`, replacing a stated engine parent with an inferred
  one; and the wing-aero form wiped the profile-drag and section-Cm polars, which
  no widget anywhere in the GUI could restore. Guard
  (`tests/test_configuration_layout_view.py`): every Apply on every page is
  pressed **without touching a widget**, and anything the project stated that has
  become unstated fails the test — one-sided by design, so Apply may still seed
  and re-derive but may never delete.

- **One owner per quantity, in the dataclasses: ten derived copies removed from
  the `Project` slices (note 33 DS-1…DS-7, review 2026-08-20 CR-A-2, tier L,
  2026-08-21).** Ten quantities were enterable in two or more places at once.
  Seven of the copies were never a second *input* at all — they were a cache of
  `Project.geometry`, filled on every run by `sync_geometry_derived` and
  deliberately never serialized — but because they were public dataclass fields
  the registry listed them, and both GUIs offered a second editable widget for a
  number the planform owns. They are gone: `FlightLoadsInput.mac`/
  `wing_area_sqft`/`xw`/`zw`, `WingMassInput.dihedral_deg`/`wrp_waterline`, and
  `LandingInput.main_gear`/`nose_gear`/`tread_in`/`wing_area_sqft`. Their values
  are resolved where they are used, by `derived_geometry.require_wing_reference`
  (or the tolerant `wing_reference` where the caller degrades rather than
  refuses), `derived_geometry.wing_plane`, and `landing.gear_geometry`. Functions
  that were handed a bare `SurfaceInput` and so could not look the parametric
  wing up now take the two wing-plane scalars as arguments — the shape
  `air_load_distribution` already used. **No schema hop and no
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump:** none of the ten was ever written to `project.json`,
  checked against all six shipped examples rather than assumed. The registry is
  down from 323 rows to 299 and from ten multi-copy quantities to four, the four
  being two genuine overrides and two entered-twice pairs that need a schema hop
  to remove and are filed rather than smuggled in. Guards: gate DG-2 asserts the
  surviving four **by name**, so removing one duplicate cannot mask another
  arriving; gate DG-3 asserts no module integrates the wing planform behind the
  resolver's back (checked against a deliberate violation), plus a numeric check
  that the two modules keeping their own area accessor agree on every fixture.
  Every Appendix A oracle passes unchanged.

- **"Download project.json" and the dirty flag describe this run's edit, not
  the last one** (review 2026-08-22 PB-4, issue #64, tier M, 2026-08-23). The
  shell sidebar rendered above `pg.run()`, so the rerun that carried a widget
  edit serialised the download and read the dirty flag *before* the page
  persisted the edit: the button served the previous interaction's project
  while the caption said clean — every last edit in the oracle GUI (no Apply),
  the Apply's own merge in `app/`. `render_shell_sidebar` is now a context
  manager around the page (`with render_shell_sidebar(project): pg.run()`,
  both GUIs): units and About render on entry, the project-file block into a
  slot reserved between them on exit. A page's early exit is
  `app_shell.components.stop_page()` — Streamlit discards everything emitted
  after `st.stop()`, the slot included, so the 45 `st.stop()` calls across the
  `app/` views were swept to it in the same change (standalone it *is*
  `st.stop()`; a guard refuses a new `st.stop()` in `app/views`). The oracle
  form's row-expander titles, which lagged the typed name for the same reason,
  read the widget state first. Guards on the real oracle entry point: one edit,
  then payload, caption and expander title in the same run; a stopping page
  keeps Save/Download. Found along the way: the shell's upload tests stubbed
  `st.file_uploader` in-process and never restored it, so any later sidebar
  test in the file was adopting a fake upload — the stubs are restored on exit.

- **An engine layout that disagrees with the engine count no longer saves a
  file the loader refuses** (review 2026-08-22 PB-7, issue #66, tier S,
  2026-08-23). `Project.__post_init__` enforced `engine_layout.expected_count
  == len(engines)` at construction only, so the two widgets on the oracle
  Engine Mount page — set in either order — produced an in-session project
  that Save wrote and `project_from_dict` raised on: "Couldn't load …" in both
  GUIs, with no JSON editor in the oracle GUI to repair it. The rule is now
  asked, not enforced: `Project.engine_layout_problem()` is its one owner, the
  loader `warnings.warn`s it (shown as a toast by the shell's load path; the
  file loads and round-trips byte-identical), the oracle form withholds the
  page's results with the message naming the Engine Mount page, and WINGGEOM's
  wing-mounted engine stations — the one consumer that reads the layout —
  refuse by the same name. Guards in `tests/test_engine_layout_consistency.py`:
  the reproduction saved and reloaded with the warning, the refusal, the
  withheld page and its release once the two agree.

- **Three files shipped in the Export bundle with no manifest row, and the one
  artifact that exists to be compared was declared on the wrong basis (CR-C-1
  `[MAJOR]` + CR-C-3 `[MAJOR]`, #42, tier M, 2026-08-22).** Appendix A is the
  bundle's statement of every file it carries and on what basis — "an artifact
  the controlling document does not name travels without a basis" is the F-D2
  finding the section was written for. One release later the class was open
  again on the newest deliverable: `lra_model.bdf` went into the zip from 0.6.0
  and into no row here, and the CLI's `--export-target lra` output was named in
  no controlling document at all. Sweeping the whole namelist rather than the
  one reported file found two more in the same state — the bundle carries the
  summary report's own `<project>_summary_report.tex` and, once compiled, its
  `.pdf`, and the manifest named every file except itself. All three now have
  rows, with the report's own pair pointing at §1.

  **The LRA row is gated on the model building, not on balanced cases
  existing.** `lra_model_bdf` refuses a project missing a datum it must not
  guess (`LraRefusal`: no resolvable SOB, no ref axis, no outline, no spars, a
  strip-pair h-tail attachment), and `concept_heavy` is exactly such a project —
  it assembles balanced cases and produces no LRA deck. The obvious gate, the
  one the review proposed, would have named a file that bundle does not carry,
  which is §4.7's *second* SHALL broken by the fix to the first. The cost is one
  model build per document, the price `_gear_cases` already pays for the gear
  row.

- **The bundle has one owner, and the gate reads the real namelist (tier M).**
  Both of §4.7's SHALLs were already written when all three files drifted past
  them: the rule was never the problem, nothing read the bundle. The old
  conformance test held the manifest against a hand-kept set in
  `test_report_content.SUMMARISED_IN`, so the two could only agree about what
  the test already believed. `sloads/report/bundle.py` is now the single owner
  of the member list — pure, Streamlit-free, importable — and `_zip_bundle` in
  the Export page loops over it instead of deciding its own members.
  `tests/test_bundle_manifest.py` asserts the two sets are **equal** on the
  fixture that exports every channel, that a refused LRA model is neither
  shipped nor manifested, and that the page writes no zip member of its own; a
  companion guard reads the page's own `_bdf_artifacts[...]` assignments, so a
  deck added to the bundle fails here before it can reach a user unnamed. The
  extraction is the whole of the change to `app/views/export_report.py` — the
  freeze holds otherwise, and the namelist is now a calc-side owner that the
  main-GUI review (#29) inherits rather than re-litigates.

- **`inertia_only.bdf` is declared LIMIT, because that is what it is (CR-C-3,
  tier S).** The manifest said ULTIMATE; the file writes `$ Per-node inertia
  load at Nz = …, LIMIT (no SF)` in band, deliberately — its writer's docstring
  is explicit that factoring one side of a comparison and not the other is how
  you make a check pass while meaning nothing, and the roundtrip M-b leg
  compares it unfactored. The controlling document and the artifact were out by
  exactly 1.5 on the one file whose only purpose is to be compared against what
  a solver recovers. The cell now reads "LIMIT (no SF) — comparison only, never
  applied". The reason it survived two reviews is that the conformance test read
  row *names*: `MANIFEST_BASIS` in `tests/test_report_content.py` now pins every
  row's basis text, exhaustively and both ways, with the five cells that name a
  live axis pinned by substring.

- **Swept with it:** `PROGRAM_SPEC.md` said `ga6_normal` and `concept_heavy`
  both refuse the LRA model by design. `ga6_normal` has built one since the
  fixture-data pass entered its reference axis and outline — the sentence went
  stale under a change that had no reason to look at it, and it is the sentence
  that says which bundles carry the row this change added. Only `concept_heavy`
  refuses. The CLI-only `lra_loads.bdf` is named in the spec's LRA section with
  its basis rather than in the bundle manifest, since it never rides the bundle.

- **A copied input now says whose copy it is, and a copy the analysis ignores no
  longer pretends to be an input (#36, review 2026-08-20 CR-A-2 `[MAJOR]`, tier M,
  2026-08-21).** The field registry has always recorded which field *owns* each
  shared quantity; nothing in the oracle GUI's renderer read it, so every holder
  rendered as an ordinary editable widget and a user could enter one wing
  reference area on Geometry and a different one on Structural Speeds with
  nothing saying they disagreed. `render_scalar` now reads the registry, and the
  marking follows a new structural flag, `FieldEntry.governs` — *does the calc
  honour this copy?* — because the two answers must render differently:
  a **display-only** copy (`governs=False`) renders **disabled**, showing the
  value that actually governs, and an **override** (`governs=True`) stays
  editable, captioned with its owner and the owner's current value, and warns
  when the two disagree. It warns rather than corrects: disagreeing is what an
  override is for, and substituting the owner's value would change results.
  The case that named the rule is `speeds.wing_area_sqft`, the "dead input" from
  the #29 review — STRSPEED integrates the wing planform and reaches this field
  only when the geometry carries no wing surface, which no GUI-built project
  lacks, so a value typed there was silently discarded (an 18 % divergence
  measured on `atr42`). It is the one display-only copy; the other four are
  overrides the calc reads verbatim, so disabling them would have removed a
  capability rather than fixed a defect. Rendering a display-only copy still
  writes nothing back, so visiting a page cannot dirty a project (OG-F). Guards:
  `tests/test_oracle_gui.py` renders every copy's page and fails on one that does
  not name its owner, on a display-only one that is still editable, on a silent
  disagreement, and on the marking becoming vacuous if the last copy ever goes;
  `tests/test_field_registry.py` fails if an owner row claims `governs`.

- **The oracle form's persist path keeps every edit — two edits in one rerun
  both land, a typed 0 lands in an unfilled Optional field, and a held-back
  table row says so (#35, review 2026-08-20 CR-A-1/CR-A-3/CR-A-6, tier M,
  2026-08-21).** `record_at` minted a fresh detached blank for **every** record
  group that walked through a missing ancestor, so on a blank project two
  widget changes in one rerun — fast typing, `data_editor` batching — could
  silently discard one of them: eight groups on the Geometry page each built
  their own blank `geometry`, and the last non-blank chain clobbered the rest
  at commit while the widget still displayed the lost value. `_PENDING` is now
  keyed on `(owner, attribute)` and every group reuses the same pending
  record. With it: an unfilled Optional scalar renders **empty**
  (`unit_number_input(value=None)`) instead of a fake `0.0`, so a deliberate 0
  — sea level, a datum-at-nose station — is now enterable (CR-A-3, same fix in
  flat-table cells); and a curve row with an empty cell is still held out of
  the stored value but the page now says so instead of letting it silently
  vanish (CR-A-6). Guards: `tests/test_dirty_flag.py` (two-edits-one-rerun on
  all four affected page shapes, typed-zero-lands, unfilled-stays-absent,
  incomplete-row caption).

- **The oracle GUI no longer dirties a project by being looked at (design note 32 step OG-F, tier M, 2026-08-20).**
  Opening an oracle page changed the project on **9 of its 14 pages** with the
  fully-populated `ga6_normal` fixture, and 12 of 14 with a sparser one: the
  sidebar showed "Unsaved changes" and the discard dialog fired at the next load,
  on a user who had typed nothing. Three causes, all in the generic renderer:
  it **attached a record** to the project merely so its widgets had somewhere to
  write; it **rewrote every field it rendered**, turning a JSON `45` into `45.0`
  — the same number, a different file; and in **SI** it converted each value out
  to metric and straight back, so `116 in` returned as `115.99999999999999` and
  the geometry walked a hair on every rerun.
  Fixed in `oracle_app/form.py`: a record created for a page is committed only
  if the pass leaves something in it, a write whose value is unchanged does not
  happen, and an untouched converted field returns the value that was stored
  rather than a reconstruction of it (the same rule `unit_number_input` already
  applied to scalars, now applied to the composite and table widgets that
  convert for themselves).
  `tests/test_dirty_flag.py` — "a render pass must not mutate the project", the
  M2-3 contract — now covers **both** front-ends, every oracle page against every
  shipped example, plus the other half without which "never write anything"
  would pass: a typed value still lands, and still attaches the record it
  belongs to. `tests/test_view_unit_roundtrip.py` adds the SI direction over
  every oracle page and pins the scalar / composite-member paths through the
  renderer.

- **The oracle GUI no longer offers a switch to concept mode, and the shared nav
  link stops swallowing real failures (review 2026-08-20 CR-A-4, CR-A-5/CR-D-10,
  CR-A-9; tier S, 2026-08-22).**
  An airplane above the FAR 23 applicability band got a **"Switch to Concept"**
  button on the oracle front-end, which carries no concept page and no concept
  field (note 32, OG-1): one click wrote `speeds.category="C"` and seeded
  `chosen_n`/`chosen_nneg` into a project only `app/` could then show. The
  applicability *warning* stays — the numbers are still an extrapolation and must
  say so — via a new `switch_action=` flag on
  `app_shell.components.render_applicability_banner` (and on `page_header`/`page`),
  which the oracle renderer passes as `False`. Pinned two ways in
  `tests/test_oracle_gui.py`: an out-of-band project renders the warning with no
  such button, and no shared-header call in `oracle_app/` may inherit the shell
  default. `tests/test_app_components.py` pins the `app/` default from the other
  side, so the flag cannot be flipped for everyone by a fix aimed at one GUI.
  Also: `workflow_page_link` narrows its `except Exception: pass` to
  `StreamlitAPIException` — the unregistered-step fallback is the `page is None`
  branch, so the broad catch only hid genuine `st.page_link` failures as silent
  text degradation, shipping a broken nav green; and `oracle_app/Oracle.py`
  resolves `oracle_steps()[0]` once for the page set instead of once per page.

- **Twelve input fields were classified as sloads additions and are inputs of the original programs (design note 32 gate G5, tier M, 2026-08-19).**
  Running the field registry rather than reading it moved `weight.items[].ixx/
  iyy/izz` and `.kind`, `geometry.surfaces[].leading_edge/trailing_edge/
  elements`, `weight.cg_cases[].weight_lb/xcg/zcg`,
  `weight.estimation.engine_weight_type` and `engines[].engine_type` from
  `Origin.SLOADS` to `Origin.ORIGINAL`. Each is settled by a citation the repo
  already carried and the table had not been read against — `MassItemKind`
  *"mirrors the data-base partition of WTONECG.BAS"*, the edge polylines are
  entered *"exactly as the original program prompts for them"*, `elements` **is**
  WINGGEOM.BAS's `H`, `EngineWeightType` holds *"the two-letter codes of the
  original program"* (WTESTIMA.BAS lines 230–290) — and by the printed oracle:
  without the per-item inertias Appendix A p136's IXX comes out **66.7** against
  the printed **1201.527**, so the oracle the suite already passes depends on
  them being entered. Nothing in the calc changed and no shipped number moved;
  what was wrong was the claim about which fields the oracle GUI could omit.
  Registry consequence: `origin` gains a companion column, `supplied`, for the
  eleven fields the second front-end writes without asking (selectors, LANDLOAD's
  three loading roles, the engine layout), so "the user is not asked" and "the
  field is not set" stop being the same claim; and `structurally_required()`
  reads declared defaults off `dataclasses.fields`, so a field the oracle GUI
  *cannot* omit can no longer be classified as omittable by accident.

- **The oracle GUI's project is the project gate G5 tests** (review 2026-08-22
  PB-1 / PB-2 / PB-3, issue #62, tier M, 2026-08-23). `Project.mass` has one
  writer: `sloads/derived.py:refresh_derived` (`weight_onecg.refresh_mass`),
  called by the `app/` Weight page on Apply, by the oracle form after every
  persist and by the G5 reduction — so a twin typed from blank reaches One
  Engine Out and Configuration's tip-back uses the Weight-DB CG (it read a
  25 %-MAC estimate: 33.1° vs 13.5° on the GA-6). `reduce_to_oracle_inputs`
  now really drops the stored result slices and the records the GUI never
  creates (a rotor row stayed, required fields intact), then re-derives; G5's
  comparison folds in the three station tables it never compared, and the
  one divergence that is decided rather than discovered — the twins' turbine
  rotors, a sloads model the original ENGLOADS never had — is declared per
  example with its number (−16 % DHC-8 mount torque) and checked to be
  exercised. `weight.items[].component` **and** `wing_fraction` are rendered
  on the oracle Weight page (`supplied`: the which-beam question BODYLOAD asked
  by position; the station tables showed the DHC-8 fuel row, 86 % wing, riding
  the fuselage beam whole), and the Fuselage Loads table states what it rests
  on — untagged items lumped by inference, an open wing-mass tie, a tail
  surface with no item. The gate's second leg, `tests/test_oracle_journey.py`,
  types the GA-6 and the DHC-8 from a blank project through the pages' own
  widgets and requires the result to be the reduced key — document, every
  download byte-for-byte, save → reload a fixed point; the scratch harness
  `scripts/oracle_journey.py` is retired into it. Along the way:
  `unit_number_input` stopped rounding its seed to four decimals (`format`
  owns display; the rounding read back as a different number to anything
  reading the widget), `FieldEntry.display_only` is the one rule behind the
  form's disabled copies and the journey's compare, and `ga6_normal` /
  `concept_heavy` carried a stored mass slice one ulp off its derivation
  (refreshed; `tests/test_derived.py` holds every example bit-identical).

- **The project is named in the sidebar, and Save never overwrites unasked**
  (review 2026-08-22 PB-6, issue #65, tier S, 2026-08-23). `project.name` is
  document metadata, so no oracle page rendered it: a project built in the
  oracle GUI was called `""` for its whole life, every *Save to disk* wrote
  `projects/project.project.json` over the last one, Open could never list
  more than that entry, and a *named* project reached the filesystem raw
  (`ATR 42-300 ("ATR 42-100" prototype … analog) — 2x PW120.project.json`:
  legal on macOS, an `OSError` on Windows). The **Project name** widget is now
  the shared sidebar's, beside the file it names, for both GUIs — the `app/`
  dashboard's copy is removed, since two widgets for one field write their
  retained state over each other. One sanitiser, `io.project_filename`
  (`[^A-Za-z0-9._-]` → `_`, runs collapsed, edges trimmed, stem capped at 64,
  never empty), names the saved and the downloaded file alike. Save remembers
  the `projects/` file a project was opened from or last saved to and writes it
  back unasked; any *other* existing file gets an overwrite dialog first. The
  `.project.json` suffix is one constant (`io.PROJECT_SUFFIX`) that Open,
  Save and the examples listing share. Guards: the sanitiser's cases, the
  widget naming the download, a fresh save then an unasked re-save, the
  overwrite refused until confirmed, Open → Save going back to the same file.

- **The residual-gate exemption has one owner, and §6 no longer declares the
  primary deliverable failed on every fixture with ground cases (CR-C-2
  `[MAJOR]`, tier M, 2026-08-22).** The report's §6 maximised the pre-closure
  residual over **all** assembled cases, so `ga6_normal` rendered *"the worst
  pre-closure residual is 143.885 % of n·W against a 1 % gate — OVER the gate"*
  — that number being the 23.427(a) maneuver tail load, which the deck's own `$`
  header, the case-table note and `balanced_cases.md` §7/§8/§9.4 all say the gate
  does not apply to. The Balanced Cases page made the same claim from a different
  wrong family (it excluded only 23.427(a), leaving the ground cases in at
  100.000 % — the applied gear reaction in full). The family the gate actually
  applies to sits at **0.624 %**. The cause named in the sentence had been retired
  on 2026-08-15 when the `body-axial` carrier landed. Now
  `balance.residual_gate_applies` owns the question — exempt where the pre-closure
  `Fz`/`My` *is* an applied load in full (ground 23.471-23.499, unsymmetrical
  h-tail 23.427(a), powered) — and `residual_gate_exemptions` states the exempt
  families, counted, beside the number, since a maximum over a filtered set is
  honest only if the filter is visible. Both surfaces read it; the over-gate
  branch now names the case and whether `Fz` or `My` drives it instead of
  asserting a cause it has not measured.

  **The lateral family is deliberately *not* exempt.** What 23.441/23.443 exempts
  is the `Fy`/`Mz` pair, and neither appears in `force_residual_fraction`
  (`|Fz|/n·W`) or `moment_residual_fraction` (`|My|/(n·W·MAC)`) — those two
  measure precisely the *symmetric half* that `is_lateral`'s own docstring names
  as the gate that does apply to it. Excluding the family, as the review's
  suggested fix would have, deletes a live gate on eight cases per fixture rather
  than correcting a false one; it passes on all six (worst 0.614 %), and
  `test_the_residual_gate_family_is_the_predicates` keeps it that way.

- **Force and pitch are judged against their own acceptances, and the force one
  is stated at the value the suite already enforced (owner's decision,
  2026-08-22, tier M).** Correcting the family exposed the second half of the
  same defect: §6 compared `max(force, pitch)` against the flat 1 %, and force
  does not meet 1 % on four of the six fixtures (atr42 2.360 %, concept_heavy
  1.994 %, dhc8 1.818 %, cessna 1.209 %, against ga6 0.624 % and the RJ 0.478 %).
  Pitch does, everywhere, with an order of magnitude to spare (0.07–0.84 %). The
  ordering tracks **fixture lift-model quality**, not the assembly — `ga6_normal`,
  the one fixture whose aero and planform come from a printed source, is best —
  and none of the six is a printed oracle: the balanced full-span model is a
  mission-extension deliverable with no Appendix A/B figure behind it, and the
  FAR23 replication core stays oracle-locked independently of it. So
  `balance.FORCE_RESIDUAL_ACCEPTANCE` (2.5 % of `n·W`) now owns the force half —
  the value `tests/test_balance.py` already enforced as the hard stop no fixture
  may cross — `RESIDUAL_GATE` (1 % of `n·W·MAC`) keeps the pitch half, and the
  report judges each against the one it is actually held to instead of declaring
  a failure against a bound nothing enforced. The test's own ceiling now *reads*
  the package owner rather than re-declaring it (a second copy of a number is how
  the report and the suite came to disagree in the first place), and the
  per-fixture, per-family `_FORCE_RESIDUAL_RATCHET` is unchanged beneath it: a
  fixture drifting from 2.360 % toward the acceptance still fails loudly, well
  before it arrives.
- **A clamped case is split out rather than judged (tier M).** Reporting the two
  components separately also surfaced that the pitch residual exceeds 1 % on
  exactly the cases whose forward non-wing axial force was **not applied** (design
  note 20 D-4: the trim α outside the polar's trusted window) — atr42 `NMAA`
  1.574 %, concept_heavy `NMAA` 2.090 %. Those are out of trim by exactly the
  clamped force and its couple about the CG, which is a measured quantity gated
  per case in `_CLAMPED_BODY_AXIAL`, so judging them against a flat acceptance
  reports a modelling decision as a failure — the same defect one layer down.
  `balance.residual_gate_family` returns `(judged, clamped)` so the report and the
  page cannot draw that line differently, and both state the clamped cases'
  standing rather than dropping them. With the split, the judged family clears
  both acceptances on all six fixtures.

  Two more sites of the same class went with it: the report's per-case table note
  named the rolling and 23.427(a) exemptions but not the **ground** rows sitting
  at 100.000 % in that same table; and the Balanced Cases page's caption on
  conditions that did not assemble still called ground, fuselage and one-engine-out
  conditions *"a deliberate exclusion … covered by the per-component analyses"*,
  false in both halves since 0.6.0 — ground conditions assemble, and the
  per-component fuselage view is flight-only permanently (D-28). That caption was
  a stale restatement of the per-reason lines above it and was deleted rather
  than re-worded; `skipped_condition_lines` is the single owner of that wording.
  The rendered §6 sentence is now pinned on a ground-assembling fixture — no test
  read the claim before, only the case objects it was derived from.

- **A renamed CG case quietly changed the loads (CR-B-4 `[MINOR]`, #43, tier M,
  2026-08-22).** Every row of the V-n matrix names the weight/CG case it was
  balanced at. When a *persisted* envelope named one the project no longer
  carried, the wing search read the weight as zero and published `nx = 0.0` into
  a WINGINER load case, and the 23.421 h-tail search dropped the candidate with
  a `continue` — a missing candidate being the harder of the two to notice,
  since it leaves no mark in the result at all. Both were reading stale
  persistence as a case with no weight. `default_envelope` — the one owner of
  "persisted, else built" — now **refuses** such a matrix (`ValueError`, naming
  what is missing, what the project has instead, and the module to re-run),
  because the mismatch invalidates every number the envelope carries and not
  only the two that happened to look for a weight. The two reads go through
  `_cg_weight`/`_cg_case` and refuse for themselves too, which covers a caller
  that threads an envelope of its own. The check is deliberately one-way: an
  **extra** flight case the matrix has not seen is an ordinary edit.

- **Two payload cases could mint one `MASSSET` label (CR-C-4 `[MINOR]`, tier
  S).** The label is the case name upper-cased, stripped to alphanumerics and
  cut to sbeam's eight characters, so "Max take-off forward CG" and "Max
  take-off aft CG" both reach `MAXTAKEO`. The SIDs stay distinct — a solver is
  unaffected — but the deck's comment block, the report's mass-case table and
  any label-reading consumer then show two cases, at two weights and two CGs,
  under one name. `massset_labels` gives the second and later claimants a numeric
  suffix in list order; the whole derivable list is passed to `massset_identity`
  rather than one loading, because uniqueness is a property of the set and a
  signature that cannot see the others cannot check it. Disambiguated rather
  than refused: the eight characters are sbeam's and the truncation is ours, so
  a project is not blocked over a display label it did not choose. **No shipped
  fixture collides** (measured: `AFTGROSS`/`FWDGROSS`/`FWDREGAR`/`MINWEIGH`/
  `MIDGROSS`, `CG1..CG4`, `CGMAX`), so no deck bytes moved.

- **`stamp()` skipped a result with no carrier, silently (CR-B-6 `[NIT]`).** An
  unstamped result is one whose report figure and whose bulk-data card can state
  different factors — the F-R1 defect class the governing table exists to close —
  so the skip is recorded in `GoverningTable.unstampable` the way `defaulted`
  records an unclassifiable case, and a test asserts it is empty on every shipped
  path, with a second that proves the recording works.

- **Every widened oracle tolerance now states the effect it comes from (CR-B-5
  `[MINOR]`).** The finding was that several Appendix-A assertions sat at 2e-3 or
  5e-3 against a ±0.1 % contract with no reason beside them. Measuring them found
  the review's two candidate reasons do not divide the way it guessed: case 21's
  speed is 0.22 % out against a print resolution of 0.08 %, so print granularity
  does not explain it, while case 21's tail load is inside the print's own half
  pound and needed no widening at all. So each tolerance is computed from what
  justifies it — the printed figure's resolution, the ±0.005 NZ band, the ±0.005
  CL band on a stall-line speed, or the NZ band through the local slope for an
  angle of attack (which lands at 0.018 deg against a measured 0.020) — and the
  one place a measured allowance stands in, the flapped LANDING case, says so
  with its numbers and its date, because there the print error is in the *input*:
  those aero polynomials are themselves read off a printed page.

- **Three guards that had rotted into always-passing (CR-C-5, CR-C-6, CR-A-8).**
  The body deck's zero-lateral assertion claimed it "goes red the day the ground
  cases land"; they landed in 0.6.0 and it did not, because D-28 made that deck
  flight-only permanently — the comment now cites the decision instead of waiting
  for an event that already happened. `test_ultimate_contract` exempted
  `export_report.py` **wholesale** on a comment's say-so, an exemption that grows
  silently with the file; the page is scanned like every other view now, with its
  two CSVs named individually and a guard that fails when a named exemption stops
  matching a real download. The oracle GUI's one-download-call-site scan covered
  only `oracle_app/`, while the shared shell renders a `download_button` inside
  that same GUI: it covers `app_shell/` too, and bounds what the shell may offer
  by *content* — the project file is an input, not a load deliverable — rather
  than by which directory it lives in. Its CSV-stamp companion accepted the
  ULTIMATE stamp anywhere in the payload, which a data row containing the words
  would satisfy; it must be in the comment block, where a consumer reads it.

- **Wording, and two already shipped (CR-A-7, CR-A-9, CR-D-9).** The oracle
  GUI's LIMIT caption said the basis travels "in its `Basis` column", which is
  wrong for the tail chordwise table — it has no such column and marks every load
  header instead — so the caption states both. Checked while sweeping: **CR-A-9**
  (the 14× `oracle_steps()[0]` recompute) and **CR-D-9** (Download writing
  `.json` where Save/Open use `.project.json`) are already fixed in the tree, and
  are recorded here as verified rather than re-fixed.

- **L-8a closed as shipped, on the evidence.** The parked row said the G6/G6b
  empennage and landing-gear forms hardcode ft²/in labels and ignore the SI
  toggle. They go through `unit_number_input` now, and
  `tests/test_view_unit_roundtrip.py` drives both directions through the very
  widgets it named — H-tail area, `xt25`, tread. Removed from `02_parked.md`.

- **Selector names are seeded, unique and case-insensitive; the category and
  strut type are codes, not text** (review 2026-08-22 PB-5 / PB-8 / PB-9,
  issue #63, tier M, 2026-08-23). The names the calc keys on — surface, CG
  case, coefficient set — were seeded `""` by the oracle form with no
  uniqueness check, so two CG cases with one name collapsed to one entry and
  TAILDIST changed in 7 of 13 rows while every page reported success.
  `sloads/selectors.py` is the owner: `select.py` builds every CG-case and
  coefficient-set lookup through `keyed`, which refuses a duplicate by name;
  `render_step` runs `duplicate_selectors` after each persist and withholds
  the page's results while a name is duplicated or blank; `NAME_SEEDS` names a
  new row (`wing` first, then `CG1 … CGn`, `CRUISE` / `LANDING`), skipping
  names already taken and never counting as a touch, so a visit still dirties
  nothing. `GeometryInput.by_name` / `AeroInput.by_name` match through
  `models.same_name` (case and edge spaces forgiven), so a surface named
  `Wing` no longer blocks eight pages, and the blocked note names the
  workflow's Geometry step instead of a page this GUI does not have. The FAR
  23 category and the strut type are codes from `models.CATEGORIES` /
  `STRUT_TYPES` (`field_registry.CODED_FIELDS` says which `str` fields carry
  one): the oracle form offers them as a choice (an unknown stored value stays
  visible, marked), the `app/` views drop their private copies of the same
  tables, the owners upper-case at construction (`"u"` is Utility), and every
  consumer goes through `normalise_code`, which refuses `"Utility"` by name
  instead of reading it as Normal's 3.8.

- **Solo scripts: `--suffix`/`--date` honoured, the expected fragment name printed, `gh` errors shown (issue #28, tier S, 2026-08-17).**
  Three things the first three closes taught: `solo_close.sh` now reads a
  `Pri N` and a date out of `--suffix` (and takes `--date`), so the close
  comment says "row N removed" and the commit date matches the fragment even
  when the fragment lead omits them; `solo_start.sh` prints the
  `changes/<slug>.<type>.md` name `solo_close.sh` will look for, so the branch
  slug and the fragment slug stop diverging (#7 and #26 both needed `--slug`);
  and both scripts surface `gh`'s own stderr instead of reporting "issue not
  found" on a GitHub 503. Guard: `tests/test_solo_scripts.py`. Closes #28.

- **The balance had no way to say it had failed, and one shipped path took it up
  on that (#33, tier M, 2026-08-22).** `_balance`'s two iterations — angle of
  attack to the required load factor, then dynamic pressure to the Mach-adjusted
  stall line — both ended the same way whether they succeeded or ran out of
  trips: fall out of the loop, return the last iterate. Every V-n point, SELECT
  pick, balanced case and exported deck downstream consumed the result with no
  way to tell the two apart (review 2026-08-20 §6 rank 2). Measured on a real
  path: a CG the airplane cannot trim at produced `NZ = 0.658` reported as a 1-g
  balanced point, angle of attack 41 deg, and carried it onward. The
  angle-of-attack iteration now **refuses** (`SolverFailure`, a `ValueError` per
  the error contract, so `run_all_modules` cannot swallow it), quoting the
  condition, the CG, the target and what it actually reached.

- **The one non-converged state that is not a failure is named, not refused.**
  Nine of `atr42_100`'s 300 points — `MAN A` / `MAN C` / `AC ROLL` at 25,000 ft
  on all three gross-weight cases — exhaust the dynamic-pressure loop, and
  decision **D-30** already ruled that state ordinary stall-limited flight:
  **23.333(b)** applies the manoeuvring envelope "except where limited by maximum
  (static) lift coefficients", and the Mach cap producing it is 23.335 a.(4)'s
  own provision. A two-state converged/failed flag would have refused three
  shipped weight cases of a shipped fixture on the strength of the regulation
  agreeing with them. So there are three outcomes: **converged**, **clamped**
  (the iterate reached a fixed point outside its band — no lever left) and
  **failed** (trips exhausted with the iterate still moving), the last raised
  rather than returned.

- **Clamped is detected as the fixed point it is, and exiting on it is free.**
  The Mach cap pins the true airspeed, so `q` returns to the same value every
  trip and each remaining trip re-solves the identical inner problem; the test is
  exact float equality on `q`, with no physics in it. Verified against the
  pre-#33 code on the fixture that clamps: all 300 V-n rows and all 300 tail rows
  **bit-identical**, and `build_envelope` 4.3× faster (39.6 ms → 9.2 ms) for not
  spinning 199 dead trips × 400 inner steps × 9 points. Every oracle, SELECT pin
  and the frozen digest are unmoved.

- **One owner for the predicate, so #32 has something to read.**
  `EnvelopeResult.clamped_cases` / `is_clamped` carry the state — derived and
  **never persisted** (`io.envelope_to_dict` names its keys, so no schema field
  and no hop; a loaded project carries it empty until FLTLOADS runs). The
  Aerodynamic Data page's stall-clamp margin finds the same corner from the
  outside, by recovering each published point's CL; the two are now pinned to
  name the **same rows**, so band-B #32's published marker reads the state the
  solver reached instead of deriving a second predicate that can drift from it.

- **Swept with it (rule 4), and closed structurally (rule 3).** The same shape
  was live in two more solvers: WINGINER's root-density iteration returned
  whatever density it was passing through when 100,000 trips ran out, and
  FLAPLOAD's slipstream search returned its own guard value — a 100,000 ft/s
  slipstream — and amplified the flap load by its square. Both refuse now. The
  gate is an **AST walk** over `sloads/`
  (`tests/test_convergence.py::test_no_bounded_search_in_the_package_falls_out_in_silence`):
  a trip-counted loop that `break`s and has no `else: raise` fails the build, or
  is classified with the reason it is not the class. Two are — ONENGOUT's time
  march (running out of steps is the end of the simulation, and `recovered`
  already states what happened) and WTESTIMA's 1 % inflation (no trip bound to
  exhaust). A loop over a collection is deliberately outside the sweep: falling
  off the end of a list means "not there", which is a fact, not an unconverged
  answer.

- **23.361(b)(1) sudden-stoppage torque is closure-gated, and its whole-integer
  truncation now floors as the `.BAS` did (CR-B-3 `[MAJOR]`, tier M,
  2026-08-22).** The condition had no numeric assertion anywhere: the engine
  tests pinned only `_prop_inertia`, and the FAR 25 test asserted only that
  25.361(a)(3)(i) *equals* it — self-consistency, not a value — so a regression
  in the rotor summation or in the Δt division would have passed the suite. It
  is twin-only and the bundled Appendix B carries no engine-mount output, so the
  gate is the formula rather than a printed figure (CONVENTIONS §6):
  `torque = I_prop·ω_prop/Δt + Σᵢ I_rotor(i)·ω_rotor(i)/Δt`, re-derived in
  `test_361_b1_closes_on_the_angular_momentum_formula` from the fixture's rotor
  list rather than from the module's own summation, and with a counter-rotating
  rotor in that fixture so the **signed** sum is pinned and not its magnitude.
- **GW-BASIC `INT()` semantics have one owner, `sloads/basic.py` (tier M,
  2026-08-22).** ENGLOADS.BAS line 944 prints `INT(-TORQSUDSTOP)` and BASIC
  `INT()` **floors**, where Python's `int()` truncates toward zero. The two agree
  on non-negative arguments and differ by exactly one unit on every negative one
  — and the stoppage argument is negative by construction, since reaction torque
  is reported negative (CONVENTIONS §5). The port therefore reported 1 ft-lb
  *less* torque than the source program, in the non-conservative direction: the
  ATR-42 fixture moves −24472 → **−24473 ft-lb** limit, at both call sites
  (23.361(b)(1) and the FAR 25 case that shares the torque). No Appendix A figure
  moves — the case is turboprop-only — and the frozen Imperial baseline was
  regenerated for that one deliberate change. Swept in the same change (rule 4):
  every `.BAS` `INT()` port now reads the owner (`basic_int` / `basic_trunc3`)
  instead of open-coding it — `engine.py` ×3, `landing.py`'s printed lever arms,
  `wing_inertia.py`'s densities, `weight_estimate.py`'s weight rows. Four of
  those had the same latent exposure and were simply not yet negative in a
  shipped fixture: a left-hand engine's Y c.g., and any LANDLOAD lever arm
  forward of the datum. Guard (rule 3):
  `tests/test_basic_semantics.py` pins the floor-vs-truncate semantics and greps
  the calc layer for a re-opened copy, with a reasoned allowlist for the one
  `int()` in `sloads/modules/` that is a step count rather than a truncation.

- **Entered tail planforms conserve SELECT's total and sit on the scalar 25 %-MAC station (issue #9, tier M, 2026-08-17).**
  Found by the first entered fixture polylines: `tail_span.distribute` normalised
  each strip by the *scalar* area, so a polyline inside the validator's ±1 % put
  that same fraction onto the deck total (atr42 h-tail +0.025 %, cessna fin
  +0.045 % against SELECT). Strips are now normalised by the quadrature's own
  area (`TailPlanform.strip_area`), so `sum(frac) == 1` on every planform and
  the derived rectangle is bit-identical. Same find, second leg (practice 4):
  `validate_tail_planform` gains a third check — the polyline's own quarter-MAC
  station must land on `xt25`/`xv25` within 1 % of the MAC — because area and
  span can agree while the strips sit fore or aft of the station the balance
  states the load at. Guards: `tests/test_tail_geometry.py`
  (`…is_tapered_and_sits_on_its_scalar_station`, `…off_its_scalar_station_is_refused`)
  and the fin-load/`n_y` identity in `test_balance.py`'s lateral pins.

- **Thirty-four project fields showed the wrong number in the SI view, and the guard that should have caught them could not see them (tier M, 2026-08-19).**
  `sloads.units` classifies a schema field by **name**, and the drift guard
  decided which names to demand a classification for from a **suffix regex** —
  `_lb`, `_in`, `_sqft`, `_hp`, `torque`, `inertia`, `psi`. A quantity whose name
  does not follow that convention was therefore invisible to the guard rather
  than reported by it. Thirty-four were: on one record the SI view showed
  `htail_semispan_in` as **1856.7 mm** and `xt25` — an inch station beside it —
  as **261.0**, and `weight.envelope.gross_weight` displayed 3400 lb as
  **3400 kg**. The rest are the unsuffixed stations and waterlines (`xt50`,
  `xv25`, `xv50`, `xtc`, `xtf`, `xw`, `zw`, `mac`, `xlemac`, `datum_x`,
  `le_root_x`, `h_tail_z`, the three `*_waterline*`, `inboard_rib_y`, the
  fuselage-section `width`/`height`/`z_centre`, `fuselage_nose_x`/`_tail_x`, the
  parametric `fuselage_length`/`width`/`height`), the gear `axle_*` points and
  the engine-mount `attach` vector, `fwd_regardless_weight`, `izz_slugft2` and
  `unbal_moment`. All are now classified, and the wing planform's
  `leading_edge`/`trailing_edge` polylines convert too — through a new
  per-member rule, because a `[[a, b], …]` curve is not one quantity twice: the
  planform edges are (station, station) and convert on both members, while
  `twist`, `profile_drag` and `section_cm` are (station, coefficient) and
  convert on the first only. Nothing in the calc, in `project.json` or in any
  oracle moves — the affected path is the Project JSON Editor's SI display,
  which was unconverted in both directions and so round-tripped perfectly while
  showing the wrong number.
  **The guard now runs the other way round:** every *numeric* schema leaf must
  be classified — converted, aviation-standard, or dimensionless with a stated
  reason — and a new one fails until somebody decides which
  (`units.field_classification`, the same totality standard gate G4 holds the
  field registry's 323 rows to). Two smaller holes closed with it: the
  aviation-standard airspeed/altitude fields are now **declared**
  (`units.AVIATION_STANDARD`) rather than implied by absence, so *stated in
  KEAS* and *forgotten* stop looking identical; and the guard's field set comes
  from `field_registry.schema_paths()` instead of one example project's slices,
  which had left every field of `one_engine_out` (absent from `ga6_normal`) and
  of `tail_mass` (set by no shipped example) outside it entirely.

- **Seven dimensional project fields displayed unconverted in the SI view**
  (units-table completeness, tier S, 2026-08-18). `units._PROJECT_FIELD_KIND`
  classifies a project-JSON leaf by field *name*, and seven fields it did not
  classify passed through the Project JSON Editor's SI view unconverted and
  unlabelled beside neighbours that converted: `thrust_lb` (lbf → N — the
  force/weight split exists precisely to keep it off the ~9.8×-different mass
  factor), `max_takeoff_weight_lb` (lb → kg) and the five lengths
  `actuator_span_in`, `hinges_span_in`, `inboard_y_in`, `outboard_y_in` and
  `sob_y_in` (in → mm). Display only — an unclassified field is unconverted in
  **both** directions, so the round trip was always lossless and no project's
  numbers ever drifted. One rule replaced the `engine_cg`/`prop_cg` special
  case: **a classified key converts whether its value is a scalar or a list of
  numbers**, which is what `hinges_span_in` (a list of hinge stations) needed
  and what the two CG vectors now ride on as ordinary rows. **The guard is the
  point** (`CLAUDE.md` rule 3): new
  `tests/test_project_units.py::test_every_dimensional_project_field_is_classified`
  walks the **type graph reachable from `Project`** rather than the fixtures —
  a round-trip test cannot see an unconverted field and no fixture entered a
  thrust, which is exactly why this class went unnoticed — and fails naming the
  field and its owning dataclass unless it is classified or listed in the new
  `units._NOT_DIMENSIONAL` with its reason (`override_max_continuous_hp` is a
  bool, not a horsepower). `CONVENTIONS.md` §7 gains the owner row.

- **The sidebar Upload is edge-triggered — the unbounded rerun loop and the
  inescapable discard dialog are gone from both GUIs (#34, review 2026-08-20
  CR-D-1/CR-D-9, tier M, 2026-08-20).** `st.file_uploader` returns the same
  file on every rerun while it sits in the widget; the shared shell re-loaded
  and re-adopted it each run (adopt → rerun → re-adopt), and on a dirty project
  reopened the discard dialog faster than Cancel could close it. The handler
  now latches on the upload's identity (`file_id`, recorded before the guard
  runs), so an upload loads exactly once, Cancel genuinely cancels, and a
  failed parse is not retried every rerun; a fresh upload re-arms the edge.
  Download writes `<name>.project.json` — the suffix Save and Open agree on —
  so a downloaded file dropped into `projects/` is listed by Open. Guards:
  `tests/test_app_shell.py` (once-across-reruns, Cancel-sticks, re-arm,
  filename convention).

- **The unkeyed half of `app/views/`: 98 project-seeded widgets keyed, the
  freshness guard fails closed** (issue #51 reopen, tier M, 2026-08-22): an
  unkeyed Streamlit widget derives its identity from its *arguments* —
  `value=` included — so a value typed before a project load survived it
  whenever the loaded field repeated the seed (the common case: the seed is
  `Project(name="")`; reproduced on `structural_speeds`' VB against
  `atr42_100`). All 98 unkeyed input widgets in `app/views/` now carry
  `key=widget_key(...)`; `test_widget_freshness.py`'s `_stamped` inverts to
  fail closed (its "no `key=` is per-render" premise was wrong),
  `_INPUT_CALLS` gains the missing input calls (`pills`, `segmented_control`,
  `file_uploader`, `camera_input`, `audio_input`, `chat_input`), the sidebar's
  whole-file exemption becomes a **per-key allowlist** with a companion test
  that fails when an entry stops naming a real widget (the #43 lesson), and a
  type-then-load reproduction test asserts the typed value does not survive
  and the loaded project is unchanged.

- **A loaded project reaches the widgets, and stale widgets can no longer
  overwrite it (#51, the data-loss half of parked L-8d, tier M, 2026-08-21).**
  Streamlit widget state, once registered under a key, beats the `value=`
  argument on every later rerun, and both GUIs keyed widgets by something stable
  across projects — the registry path in `oracle_app/form.py`, a hand-written
  name in `app/views/`. `adopt()` replaced `st.session_state["project"]` and
  touched no widget key, so a page **visited before** a load kept rendering its
  own retained state and wrote it back over what had just been loaded: opening
  the oracle GUI on the seed project, visiting Weight & Mass Properties and
  loading `atr42_100` showed `0` / `""` / 0 rows, and the row-count widget's `0`
  popped all 21 `weight.items` and all 8 `weight.cg_cases` out of the loaded
  project — on the load's own rerun, since that GUI has no Apply step, and onto
  disk on the next Save. New `app_shell/widget_keys.py` stamps every such key
  with a **project generation**, bumped once per replacement (`adopt`, and the
  JSON editor's Apply, which replaces the project without saving it); a
  mutation, an Apply or a unit switch is not a replacement and keeps its
  widgets. Swept across all 21 `app/views/` modules (practice 4), where the
  Apply step defers the same overwrite rather than preventing it. Guards:
  `tests/test_widget_freshness.py` — render → load → re-render leaves the
  session project equal to the loaded file on every oracle page × every shipped
  example, the widgets show the loaded values, and an AST walk fails on any GUI
  widget keyed without the stamp.

- **`WorkflowStep.bas` said "—" where it meant "none"** (design note 32 OG-3,
  tier S, 2026-08-19). `bas` names the original McMaster program behind a step
  and is `None` for a modern page, but `tail_span_loads` and `balanced_cases`
  — both sloads-only capability (plans 09 and 11) — carried the em dash `"—"`
  instead. An em dash is truthy, so the natural "original programs only" filter
  `[s for s in STEPS if s.bas]` silently claimed two modern pages as ported
  ones (15 steps, not the true 13), and the Home dashboard rendered a dangling
  `" · —"` beside each. Both are now `None`. New guard
  `tests/test_workflow.py::test_bas_is_a_program_name_or_none` asserts the
  *shape* — every non-`None` `bas` is a `+`-joined uppercase program name — so
  any future sentinel fails rather than the two known values being pinned.
  Metadata only: no module, no load, no schema field changes.

- **Self-sufficient pages no longer send the user upstream for their own
  inputs** (CR-D-3, issue #45, tier M, 2026-08-22): on a fresh project, 2 of
  the 14 oracle pages said "run the pages before this one first" for a slice
  **their own form enters** (`weight_mass`/`weight`, `engine_mount`/`engines`).
  `WorkflowStep` gains `edits` — the slices a page's own form enters, declared
  minimally — and `workflow.missing_upstream` / `missing_self_entered` split a
  missing requirement by remedy: the oracle blocked note now points a
  self-entered slice at the form above, and the Dashboard shows those steps as
  ready-to-enter rather than blocked. A DAG-completeness guard
  (`tests/test_workflow.py`) holds every `requires` to some step's `produces`
  or some step's `edits` (the Step-G6 `tail_loads`/`vtail_loads` proxies are
  declared on Geometry, guarded to fall out when #52 retires them), with a
  field-registry rot companion on each declaration. The never-called `page()`
  context manager and its `_PRODUCER` map were removed from
  `app_shell/components.py` — every view gates with its own page-specific
  `gate()` call, which is now the documented pattern of record.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added

- **Solo close loop as scripts — `scripts/solo_start.sh` + `scripts/solo_close.sh` (issue #27, tier S, 2026-08-17).**
  `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0's loop is now a guarded command sequence rather
  than a chat transcript (rule 3). `solo_start.sh <issue> <type>/<slug>`
  preflights (on `main`, clean tree, `gh` authenticated, issue open, branch
  new) and opens the branch; `solo_close.sh <issue> "<Subject>"` refuses until
  the tier's `changes/` fragment(s) exist and the item's `(#N)` row has left
  the priority table, then runs gate → commit → `--ff-only` land + push →
  `gh issue close` with the `main` SHA → verify (branch delete,
  `backlog_issues.py check`, issue state, last CI run), stopping at the first
  failure with the recovery printed; `--dry-run`, `--skip-gate`, `--yes`,
  `--slug`, `--suffix`. Guard: `tests/test_solo_scripts.py` (`bash -n`,
  `--help`, dry-run step order). §0 points at the scripts. Closes #27.

- **LRA beam-model design review** (backlog band B, steps 12/13/14; design note
  `docs/30_future/24_lra_beam_model_review_note.md`, **agreed 2026-08-15**, no
  code). The user's eight-feature target — control-surface hinge/actuator nodes,
  wing side-of-body node with inboard loads summed to it, fuselage beam with
  front/rear-spar posts, fin and h-tail attachments (conventional and T-tail),
  LRA at 40 % chord / hinge line / section centre, gear and engine thrust nodes —
  measured against the shipped export code and the written plans. Establishes
  that the LRA model is a **third deliverable** (the assembled balanced deck is
  `GRID`+`FORCE`/`MOMENT` with no elements and stays so), records decisions
  **BM-1…BM-5** (SOB source, split-fuselage idealization, refuse-on-missing
  attachment data, explicit `mounted_on`, named-node contract) and re-sequences
  band B. Docs amended in the same session: backlog step 12/13/14 bodies and
  Pri 1/10/16, plan 10 §1.1 (constraint 1 scoped to the per-component deck),
  plan 11 §4 (LRA-model column, T7 transfer and engine-thrust rows), plan 09
  §10 (**T-18**, hinge-line control chains), note 21 (**P-6a**, hub/mount
  nodes), `docs/00_INDEX.md`. Standard docs, schema and `bands.py` follow the
  code per the closure tiers.
- **`CgCase` gains an explicit loading definition** (backlog Pri 6, decision
  **D-25** + D-25a…d; schema **v50**; design note
  `docs/30_future/22_d25_cgcase_loading_note.md`). A payload case could state a
  weight and a CG but not *what loading produces it*, so the mass model behind
  every case was reconstructed by searching the discretionary subsets of
  `weight.items` for something that reproduced the corner point within a credible
  ballast fraction — which reached **7 of 18** shipped cases and left four
  fixtures with no balanced case at all. `CgCase.loading` (new
  `LoadingDefinition`: items aboard, a fraction for any `consumable` row, an
  optional entered ballast row with its waterline) states it instead. The entered
  loading is **authoritative** (D-25a): the case's `weight_lb`/`xcg`/`zcg` become
  a checked echo — `max(0.5 lb, 0.1 %)` and `0.5 in` — reported by
  `mass_distribution.case_loading_checks` and as two new Weight & CG findings
  (`cg_case_loading_echo`, `cg_case_loading_invalid`), and no ballast is ever
  solved for one. The credibility gate stays on *solved* ballast only (D-25d), so
  an entered ballast exports with its fraction stated rather than being refused.
  **Optional with the search as fallback** (D-25c): every pre-v50 file loads and
  produces byte-identical output, and a case without a loading writes no
  `loading` key. First user: `concept_regional_jet`'s **CG3 fwd light** (12 %
  ballast, previously refused), which brings the fixture's `NMAA` condition into
  the assembled deck — its flight family is now complete, and the payload-case
  table in the report and on the page states `entered` or `derived` per case so
  the provenance travels with the mass model.

- **The assembled model carries the airplane's non-wing drag** (backlog Pri 5,
  design note `docs/30_future/20_body_drag_carrier_note.md`). The FLTLOADS trim
  balances the airplane-less-tail drag from the **polar**; the assembled model's
  only `fx` was the wing strips' own chordwise force, so the fuselage, nacelle
  and remaining parasite drag was simply absent — `residual_fx` *equalled* the
  wing's drag, and the couple that missing force left about the CG was the whole
  of the pre-closure pitch residual. New `balance.body_axial_set` applies it as a
  labelled `body-axial` load, spread over the fuselage outline by
  cross-section-area share where there is one. **Every family on both fixtures
  falls to the lift-model floor — 0.014–0.086 % against a 1 % gate — so the
  per-fixture pitch ceiling is retired** (`_PITCH_RESIDUAL_CEILING` becomes
  `_PITCH_RESIDUAL_RATCHET`, which records what each family actually reaches so
  the flat gate cannot pass a 12× regression in silence), and plan 13's G9
  inherits the flat gate. The longitudinal closure now reads the trim's own drag:
  ga6 PHAA `nx` 0.661 g → **0.610 g**, exactly `dx/W`.

  That the gap is genuinely parasite drag is measured, not assumed: both models
  resolve through the same `α`, so the body-axis difference decomposes exactly
  into wind-axis parts, and `ΔL/L` comes out ≤ 0.6 % while `ΔC_D` is a
  near-constant **−0.018 across all seven `ga6_normal` cases** — a `C_D` offset
  independent of `C_L`. Above `α ≈ 19°` on the regional jet it inverts sign,
  because the strip model's induced drag overshoots the polar there; that is
  reported as a case note rather than clamped, since clamping would hide it.

  New input `LayoutInput.body_drag_waterline_z` (**schema v49**, additive, no
  hop) with its single owner `derived_geometry.body_drag_waterline`. Its
  resolution order is deliberately **two branches** — explicit, else the wing
  reference plane with a loud `assumed` note. There is no geometry branch, and
  its absence is the decision: the suite has no body-centreline datum
  (`FuselageSection` carries no `z`), `root_waterline_z` is the *wing* root, and
  deriving from it would put `ga6_normal`'s `SIDE GUST` residual at −1.173 %,
  over the gate on the Appendix A fixture — as well as being a trap, since that
  fixture's `fuselage_height` is 0.0 and any geometry-conditioned branch would
  flip the first time a fixture gained a body. `BalancedCaseResult` gains
  `body_axial` and `delta_cd`; the latter is reported because carrying the load
  makes the applied axial resultant equal the trim's `dx` **by construction**, so
  the diagnostic that found the defect would otherwise vanish with it.

  Imperial baseline: only `csv/balance`, `txt/balance` and `sbeam/balanced_deck`
  moved, and only on the two fixtures with balanced cases — every per-component
  deck and every Appendix A oracle is byte-unchanged.

- **The authoritative package tree is as-built, has one owner, and is guarded**
  (0.6.0-candidate review finding **R6-D5**). `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` §4 was still the
  *proposed* restructure layout and had drifted past three SSOT owners added in
  one cycle (`cg_cases.py`, `safety_factors.py`, `gear_loads.py`) plus
  `case_ids.py`, `rigid_body.py`, `tail_geometry.py`, `aero_curves.py`,
  `migrations.py`, `spec_names.py`, the `models/` package split, and three
  `export/` lines mis-nested under `mass_distribution.py`. It is now the shipped
  tree, file for file, with a one-line purpose per module. The duplicate,
  staler tree in `00_program_overview.md` is replaced by a shape summary and a
  link (user decision: one owner). New `tests/test_package_layout.py` rebuilds
  each path from the tree's own indentation and asserts the `sloads/` half
  matches the package on disk in **both** directions — an unlisted new module,
  a listed file that does not exist, and a mis-nested line all fail; the second
  tree cannot come back. Docs and test only.

- **The ground family is in the balancing-method theory document** (0.6.0-candidate
  review finding **R6-D7**). `docs/20_theory/balanced_cases.md` described three
  families where four ship; it gains **§9 — the ground families (FAR
  23.471–23.499)**: what a ground case does not have (no V-n point, no given load
  factor, no balancing tail load, its own design weight under 23.473(a)), which
  of LANDLOAD's 33 cases assemble and why the 23.499 family does not, the applied
  set (`gear-main`/`gear-nose` with the exact patch→node transfer, `ground-lift`
  along the ground line on cases 1–12 only), the `n_z = 0` solve against FAR
  23.471 with the `NVP`/`NDP`/`NS` identity and its rotational half, `ρ` measured
  from LANDLOAD's own two resolutions, **why `RESIDUAL_GATE` does not apply** and
  the gates that replace it, and a worked example over three families on
  `ga6_normal`. §2's source table and §3's not-gated list gained their ground
  rows; the pin table is now §10, with ten ground rows. Two new tests in
  `tests/test_gear_report.py` pin every figure the new section quotes, per the
  document's own contract. Docs and test only — no shipped number moves.

- **`balance` and `tail_span` have PROGRAM_SPEC sections, and every module is
  now guarded into having one** (0.6.0-candidate review finding **R6-D6**). The
  two registered modules the per-module spec skipped — `balance`, which carries
  the mission's primary deliverable and the whole ground-case assembly, and
  `tail_span`, which carries steps 7–9's physics including the suite's first
  hinge moment — are specified on the document's own FAR §/Source/Reads/Writes/
  Validation/Notes template, citing plans 09/11/13/18, `CONVENTIONS.md` and
  `balanced_cases.md` rather than restating them. New `sloads/spec_names.py`
  owns the registry-name → spec-heading map (`weight_estimate` → `WTESTIMA`,
  modern modules under their own name) together with the allowlist of sections
  that are not calc modules (`TAU`, `LGFACTOR`, `payload_cases`, `gear_loads`,
  the export bridges), and `tests/test_spec_coverage.py` guards both directions:
  a new module with no section fails, and so does a section matching neither.
  The status-summary note now names all four modern additions. Docs and test
  only — no shipped number moves, no digest channel changes.

- **G-6's rotational gate half, as the design note wrote it** (0.6.0-candidate
  review finding **R6-T1**, with **R6-T2** folded in). The step-10 benchmark
  shipped with its translational half only — `NVP`/`NDP`/`NS` exact at
  `rel_tol 1e-9` — while the three moment lines the note promised
  (`Iyy·θ̈ == PITCHP + the lift term`, `Ixx·φ̈ == ROLLP`, `Izz·ψ̈ == YAWP`) were
  never written. They are now, in
  `test_the_ground_closure_reproduces_landloads_unbalanced_moments`: the solved
  `[I]{ω̇}` is transferred from the mass centroid to the CG, the **G-7a** lift
  term is rebuilt in closed form (`L × W` along the ground line) and subtracted,
  the applied reactions are moved from the **contact patch** to whichever arm
  point that family's own LANDLOAD formula measures to, and the result is rotated
  into the ground line and compared per family. The one-wheel family's
  `ROLLP`/`YAWP` are identities (`rel_tol 1e-9`, measured 4e-16 — the tread arm
  is shared geometry); every other line is bounded at `1e-4 · W · MAC`, the
  cause being that the BASIC truncates its printed lever arms to 3 decimals.
  A negative control pins both corrections as non-trivial (arm point 12.5 %,
  lift term 5.8 % on `ga6_normal` case 4). `NS` is now compared **signed**
  (R6-T2) instead of by magnitude. `InertiaTensor.moment()` — the forward
  direction of `solve()` — is the new single owner of `[I]{ω̇}`, guarded in
  `test_the_solve_inverts_the_tensor_including_its_coupling`. Test-only: no
  shipped number moves and no digest channel changes.

  **What the gate found** (recorded, not fixed — it is an oracle question):
  `LANDLOAD.BAS` resolves the **ground-roll attitude** at `PHIM = +BETA(2)`
  where the level and tail-down attitudes use `GAMMA − BETA(1)` and `−BETA(3)`,
  so on that attitude `ρ = +GRA` against `ρ = −GRA` everywhere else. The port is
  faithful to the BASIC on both. The consequence: on `ga6_normal` the 23.485
  family's own `ROLLP` (built on `CP`, a contact-line arm) and `YAWP` (built on
  `BP`, an axle arm resolved through `BETA`) are stated 2·GRA(2) = 9.45° apart
  and cannot both be reproduced by any single rigid rotation; the braked-roll
  family's pitch carries the same difference (0.6–3.2 %, bounded at 5 % with the
  cause named). An airplane that sits level (`GRA(2) = 0` — the regional jet and
  both twins) cannot see it at all. Pinned on all five gear fixtures by
  `test_the_ground_roll_attitude_is_resolved_against_the_other_sign`. **Decided
  the same day (user, 2026-08-15): keep the manual's convention — this is a
  faithful replication.** No deviation is taken; the reasoning, the exposure and
  the tests that hold it are recorded under "Considered and declined" in
  `docs/20_theory/02_approved_corrections.md`, which is where the question
  resumes should a legible printed oracle ever surface.

- **Ground and landing cases, and the gear load report** (**step 10 piece 3**,
  decisions **G-1/G-6/G-7(+G-7a)/G-8/G-9/G-12(+G-12a)/G-13**, schema **v48**) —
  the 0.6.0 headline, and the step that **absorbs step 11 (plan 11 B8b)**. The
  FAR 23 ground conditions become **balanced free-free cases in the assembled
  full-span deck**, and the gear gets a deliverable of its own.

  **Ground cases are born in the assembled deck, not in a per-component view**
  (G-1). A ground case is irreducibly three-dimensional — on `ga6_normal` braked
  roll is 2,261 lb vertical against 1,809 lb of drag per wheel, and the side
  family 2,261 against −1,700 lb of side load, applied at a contact patch ~41 in
  below the fuselage beam line and ±57 in off the centreline — and those lever
  arms *are* the load case, while the per-component fuselage deck is planar by
  construction. LANDLOAD cases **1–24** assemble (27 cases on `ga6_normal`, 18 on
  `concept_regional_jet`, twins included); the 23.499 supplementary nose-wheel
  family is skipped **with a recorded reason**, because it carries nose reactions
  only and so is not an airplane in equilibrium.

  **The closure is the regulation's own sentence, and its gate is a closed form.**
  FAR **23.471** requires the external reactions to be "placed in equilibrium with
  the linear and angular inertia forces in a rational or conservative manner"; a
  ground case therefore enters the shipped six-DOF rigid-body closure with **no
  base load factor at all** — the whole field is solved (G-6). LANDLOAD's
  `NVP`/`NDP`/`NS` are deliberately **not consumed**: they are translation only,
  they are stated about the ground line, and consuming them would put a frame
  rotation in the load path. They are the **independent check** instead, and the
  agreement is exact — rotate the solved field back to the ground line and it
  reproduces all three factors on **every case of both fixtures** to
  floating-point noise. That is content-carrying rather than self-referential:
  LANDLOAD reaches those factors by lever arms and FAR percentages, with no mass
  matrix anywhere in it.

  **Wing lift on the landing families only** (G-7), on the AIRLOADS Schrenk
  spanwise shape scaled to `L × W` — only the *shape* is borrowed, so no speed,
  CL or V-n point is involved and no aerodynamics is invented. The split is the
  manual's and the regulation's, not a new one: 23.473(a) lets 23.479/481/483 be
  met at the design landing weight, and 23.485/23.493 are the gross-weight ones.
  The ground-handling families carry **no lift** — the wing is lift-free, not
  load-free. New sub-decision **G-7a**: the lift acts along the **ground line**,
  not the airplane `z` axis, because lift is perpendicular to the flight path and
  the ground line is the flight path at touchdown; this is also what keeps G-6's
  gate an identity rather than a tolerance, since LANDLOAD sums `lf·WL` into the
  ground-line vertical.

  **Handedness keeps its single owner and gains an external check** (G-8). The
  23.483 one-wheel family has no twin in the manual, so both hands are minted
  (`LG-10R`/`LG-10L`); the 23.485 side family ships **both** drift directions
  already, so the odd member is assembled and the even one derived by
  **reflection** — which makes LANDLOAD's own even-member `NS`/`ROLLP`/`YAWP` the
  only *external* check the reflection operator will ever get. Their ids stay
  LANDLOAD's (`LG-19` port, `LG-20` starboard, no suffix), so
  `case_ids.balanced_subcase_id` now takes the case's **hand explicitly** instead
  of parsing an id suffix — identical for every previously shipped case.

  **The gear load report** (G-12) — a stamped companion CSV, a numbered report
  section, a Streamlit view, a manifest row and a CLI target
  (`--export-target gear`). It is a **free body**, not a load list: per case and
  per leg it states the reaction at the tyre contact patch in the ground-line
  frame the manual prints, with the strut state, ground angle and stroke it was
  computed at, and the *same* reaction where the airframe receives it. Both ends
  of the leg, so the two ground artifacts are provably one load seen from two
  sides — and that identity is checked **through the real solver**, which
  reassembles the load from the card text and its own `GRID` lever arms. It
  carries **all 33 cases** against the assembled deck's 24, and reaches **five**
  fixtures against the assembled cases' two, because it needs no mass model; both
  coverage sets are pinned. Sub-decision **G-12a** adds
  `LandingGearInput.weight_lb` (the whole leg, trunnion down) so the free body
  closes; `0.0` means *not stated* and the report shows the free body **open**
  rather than closing it against a guess. What the report is **not** is stated
  in-band: sloads has no gear kinematic model, so it claims no drag-brace,
  side-brace, trunnion or axle-bending load, and its inertia term is the leg at
  the *airplane* load factor — unsprung-mass amplification, which is what
  actually sizes an axle, is not modelled.

  **Ground cases are a separate governing family** (G-9): never auto-compared
  with flight cases for a maximum, because the two load different structure by
  different paths and a cross-family `max()` destroys the one thing a governing
  table exists to say. That is now a **standing limitation** and a paragraph in
  the report rather than something to be inferred from the absence of a
  comparison. They are, however, brought within reach of the engineer's opt-out
  filter — the Critical Loads page gains a Landing gear section — so the family
  is scopable instead of silently unreachable.

- **The weight/CG case model and the gear inputs — one schema hop** (**step 10
  piece 2**, decisions **G-2/G-3/G-4/G-5/G-14**, schema **v47**). Three weight/CG
  case lists and six representations of MTOW collapse to **one owner each**,
  `sloads/cg_cases.py`. Each `CgCase` now states the `analyses` it is run for
  (`FLIGHT` / `GROUND`, a *set*, so one case can feed several rather than being
  entered twice under two names and drifting apart) and, where it is one of
  LANDLOAD's three, its `role`. `FlightLoadsInput.cg_cases` and
  `LandingInput.cg_cases` are **removed**: the first had been a derived copy of
  `weight.cg_cases` since v19 kept in step by the *Flight Envelope page* rather
  than by the model, so a calc-only front end could hold two different lists; the
  second never joined the SSOT at all. `WeightInput` gains
  `max_landing_weight_lb` (moved off `LandingInput`) and `max_takeoff_weight_lb`
  as the single owners of those two certified limits, `MassItem` gains
  `consumable`, and `LandingGearInput` gains `carrier` (`body` | `wing`, **no
  default**) and `attach`, the trunnion node the ground export will transfer the
  contact-patch reaction to.

  **Three latent defects leave with the fields they lived on.**
  `landing.gross_weight_lb` fell back to `max(landing cg_cases)` — which is
  **MLW, not MTOW** — making `WR = 1.0` and understating the braked-roll, side and
  supplementary-nose cases by ~5 % for any project that left it unset. LANDLOAD's
  three loadings are indexed **positionally** and their order used to be recovered
  by *matching names*, falling back to entry order with only a warning, so renaming
  a row silently reordered a reaction table oracle-locked to Appendix A p230;
  `CgCase.role` makes that a field, and `cg_cases.landing_role_cases` raises rather
  than reordering or padding. And `direct_totals()`'s first element, documented as
  MTOW, is the sum of every database row — an upper bound wearing the name of a
  design limit, 964 lb high on `atr42_100` and 1,800 lb on the RJ; it is renamed to
  the database total and becomes the **ceiling** of the ordering chain
  `OEW ≤ MLW ≤ MTOW ≤ Σ items`, which replaces four scattered checks with one.

  **Two new physical rules, both regulation-cited.** `consumable` marks mission
  fuel, and deriving a loading for a `GROUND` target now **burns it down**
  continuously and proportionally before dropping any payload — a design landing
  weight is fuel burned off (14 CFR 23.473(b)/(c)), not a passenger left behind.
  Measured on `ga6_normal`, the old subset search dropped the 6th person (x = 150,
  aft cabin) and kept all 409 lb of fuel (x = 70); burn-down reaches the case by
  burning **317 lb** and lands **0.12 in** from its target CG. And `carrier` is an
  input because body-carried and wing-carried gear are different **load paths**:
  applying a wing-carried reaction to the body beam over-loads the fuselage *and*
  hides a real wing sizing case.

  **New guards** (practice 3): the design-weight ordering chain; `MLW < OEW + max
  payload + reserve fuel`, which fires on `concept_regional_jet` (31,000 against
  31,360 — that airplane cannot land at MLW with full payload and reserves);
  carrier ↔ gear-mass agreement, which fires on `dhc8_dash8` (main gear in
  wing-mounted nacelles, mass tagged `fuselage`); `attach` plausibility against the
  wing planform; an empty `analyses` set; a `role` on a case not tagged `GROUND`;
  and MTOW drift between the SSOT and the representations it replaced.

  **GUI:** the Weight & Mass Properties page's **Payload Cases** tab is the sole
  editor, with `FLIGHT`/`GROUND`/`role` columns and the WTENV landing seed (now
  the pure helper `cg_cases.seed_landing_cases`, offered on a button, never written
  by a render); its Weight / CG Envelope tab owns MLW and MTOW and offers the
  derived MLW estimate for acceptance; the Landing Loads page's CG table and both
  weights are **read-only**.

  **Nothing moved.** Migration `_v46_cg_case_model` is output-neutral by
  construction — every value it writes comes from the file's own, MTOW from
  `speeds.weight_lb`, which measurement showed equals the other four
  representations on every shipped fixture. Every Appendix-A oracle, every fixture
  digest and every exported deck is unchanged; the `FLIGHT`-tagged set after
  migration is pinned, per fixture, to equal the pre-hop `flight_loads.cg_cases`
  exactly.

- **The governing safety-factor table — one authority for every case's factor**
  (**M4-8**, step 10 piece 1, decisions **G-10/G-11**). The factor of safety was
  previously decided ad hoc: a dataclass default of 1.5, one module overriding it,
  and two silent `getattr(item, "safety_factor", ULTIMATE_FACTOR)` fallbacks in the
  report that reported 1.5 for a factorless case leaving no trace. `sloads/
  safety_factors.py` is now the single code owner: **one row per condition family**,
  each stating its factor, its regulatory **basis** and its status (`derived` /
  `override` / `defaulted`). The family boundaries are **14 CFR Subpart C's own
  section groupings**, so the granularity is the regulation's, and every per-case
  SF — the report case index's column, the load-case CSVs, a deck's `SF=` marker —
  is a derived view of a row. `GoverningTable.factor_for()` classifies a case from
  its FAR reference and the table **writes the carrier** at the three boundaries
  every front-end shares, so a report figure and its bulk-data card cannot state
  different factors for one case (review **F-R1**'s defect class, re-armed for the
  override path). It travels as report **§3 Governing safety factors** and the
  stamped companion `<project>_safety_factors.csv`, both named in the manifest.
  The table is **fully user-editable including the regulation rows**
  (`Project.safety_factors`, schema **v46**, additive, no hop) — safe for the
  oracles, since the factor is applied at the render/export boundary only, but not
  for the deliverable, so an override is declared in the report **and** the methods
  stamp, must state a basis, and raises a **certification-risk** warning when it
  sits below the value the regulation derives. An unclassifiable case takes 1.5 and
  is **flagged**, never silently accepted. Acceptance is reproduction: the table
  resolves exactly the factor every producer mints, case by case, on all six
  shipped fixtures, with **zero defaulted rows and zero overrides** — **no number
  moved and no digest changed.**
- **Discrete control surfaces, and the suite's first hinge moment** (plan 09
  **T6**). Setting `control_load_mode = "discrete"` on a tail surface — with
  `hinges_span_in` and `actuator_span_in`, new per-surface schema (**v45**,
  additive, no hop) — takes the control surface's own load **out** of the
  smeared spanwise strips and applies it where the airplane applies it: hinge
  reactions by chord-weighted tributary span at dedicated `GRID`s on the load
  reference axis (bands `5001+` elevator, `5301+` rudder), with the
  hinge-moment couple at the actuator node. The control load is **SELECT's own**
  (`elevator_load` / `load_on_rudder`, oracle-locked, now split into its camber
  and angle-of-attack parts so each leaves the distribution at the chord station
  TAILDIST placed it at) where the condition publishes one, and derived from
  TAILDIST's aft-of-hinge pressure block — and marked derived — where it does
  not. The **hinge moment** is that load on a third of the aft-of-hinge chord,
  which is exact rather than approximate because the net trailing-edge pressure
  is identically zero and the block is therefore always a triangle; it is
  reported as a load value, shown on the Tail Span Loads page and stated in the
  deck `$` header. The two modes apply **exactly** the same total force
  (`rel_tol 1e-12`, a property of the construction, not of the quadrature), and
  the root-torsion difference between them is gated as a closed form — one
  chordwise relocation of the control load to its own centre of pressure — not
  as a tolerance. Selecting the mode without attachment geometry raises rather
  than falling back, and `"smeared"` remains the default: **no shipped fixture
  carries hinge geometry and no shipped deck changed by a byte.**
- **A T-tail's fin deck carries the horizontal tail at its tip** (plan 09
  **T7**). `TailType.T_TAIL` had driven only the three-view sketch; it is now a
  load path. Each vertical-tail case's deck gains, at the fin's **last** node
  (no new `GRID`), the h-tail load concurrent with that case — the balancing
  tail load at its own V-n point plus the h-tail's inertia there — as a vertical
  `FORCE` and the `MOMENT` its two lever arms make, the balancing load about the
  tail CP the V-n point publishes and the mass about the planform's own
  centroid. Roll and yaw transfer are zero and the deck says why (the pairing is
  a balancing condition, so the h-tail's halves cancel about the centreline).
  `concept_regional_jet` is the suite's only T-tail fixture, and its fin deck
  was previously the deck a *conventional* airplane would have had.

- **ONENGOUT runs on shipped data.** `atr42_100` and `dhc8_dash8` now enter
  take-off and max-continuous shaft power on both engines (PW120 2000/1700 shp,
  PW121 2150/1950 shp — converted from the certificated kW in EASA TCDS
  IM.E.041 issue 07, 20 Dec 2023 §5). The FAR 23.367 one-engine-out module was
  previously unrunnable on every bundled example, so its simulation path was
  exercised only by unit tests on constructed inputs. Each airplane gains three
  vertical-tail conditions (`VT-30`…`VT-32`). **Their VS cases do not recover**
  — full asymmetric power at the clean stall speed is below VMC — and say so on
  the case, as designed.
- **New standing limitation, `engine-failure-propeller-only`:** the 23.367 model
  is propeller-only (thrust from shaft power over true airspeed, Glauert
  windmilling on the propeller disc), so a turbofan/turbojet multi is not
  covered and its asymmetry would be understated. Carried in every
  methods-and-limitations stamp; `concept_regional_jet` deliberately enters no
  one-engine-out slice. Refusing to run on a non-propeller installation remains
  open (backlog M4-3(b)).

### Changed

- **Documentation currency rule + guard (tier M, 2026-08-16).** A standard doc
  never states a number that describes the code's current state — schema
  version, test count, coverage %, "currently N", "version is now X" — it points
  at the owner (`SCHEMA_VERSION` in `sloads/models/project.py`, CI, the generated
  `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`); provenance stays as `schema vN`. Rule:
  `00_program_overview.md` §Documentation currency, `CLAUDE.md` required
  practices, `CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` step 1. Guard `tests/test_doc_currency.py`:
  literal patterns over `README.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`docs/00_INDEX.md`/`10_standard/`/
  `20_theory/` (generated data dictionary exempt), plus `docs/00_INDEX.md` ↔ the
  docs tree both ways (a doc with no INDEX row, or a row with no file, fails —
  the R6-D2 class). Swept on first find: four `SCHEMA_VERSION = N` currency
  claims in `GUI_design.md` and `PROGRAM_SPEC.md` rewritten as provenance or
  pointers. Origin: the review's finding that R6-D1…D8 shipped past the
  structural guards.

- **Doc volume: history archived to 0.5.0, changelog fragments, tier S trimmed
  (backlog R11 closed, tier M, 2026-08-16).** Design note
  `docs/30_future/26_doc_volume_reduction_note.md`, all three recommendations
  accepted at user review. (a) `docs/40_history/00_completed_development.md`
  cut at the 0.5.0 release block; ~7,970 pre-0.5.0 lines moved verbatim to the
  frozen `11_completed_development_to_0.5.0.md`. (b) `[Unreleased]` is no
  longer hand-edited: each closure drops one `changes/<slug>.<type>.md`
  fragment (this entry is the first) and `scripts/build_changelog.py X.Y.Z
  --date …` assembles them at release cut; `tests/test_changelog_fragments.py`
  guards fragment names/shape and warns when the live history passes 1,500
  lines. (c) Tier S closure = fragment + backlog removal, no history entry
  (`CLAUDE.md`, `CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` §0). `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §4 gains a
  mechanical history-roll step. Legacy hand-written `[Unreleased]` text folds
  into 0.6.0 verbatim.

- **Effect-vs-error-bar rule promoted to `CLAUDE.md` rule 6 (tier S,
  2026-08-16).** The 2026-08-16 scope review's ordering rule — a fidelity item is
  ranked only if its stated effect on a delivered load exceeds the base method's
  own uncertainty, otherwise parked *with the number that parks it*; a defect
  with first-order effect on shipped content outranks every fidelity item —
  lived only in the backlog's header, i.e. in a plan file. It is now rule 6 in
  `CLAUDE.md` (pointer, no number: the datum is a new
  `theory_sources.md` §Base-method uncertainty section — rigid airplane, Schrenk
  span load, lumped tail; order 5–10 % on a distributed load, tighter on the
  oracle-pinned totals — stated once, as an order of magnitude that ranks work
  and gates no test); the backlog header points at the rule. `CLAUDE.md` stays
  inside its ~160-line budget (three prose lines tightened, no rule dropped).
  Closes item 10 of the 2026-08-16 code-standard summary.

- **Multi-developer development process (design note 28, MD-1…MD-12, tier M,
  2026-08-16).** Trunk-based branches + protected `main` (PRs only, 1 reviewer ≠
  author, CODEOWNERS review, squash-merge; `self-merge-ok` for tier-S docs/hygiene
  PRs on green CI); **closure travels in the PR**; **history entries become
  `changes/<slug>.history.md` fragments** rolled to the top of the history file
  at release cut by `scripts/build_changelog.py` (tier M paragraph / tier L step;
  guarded in `tests/test_changelog_fragments.py`); **GitHub Issues + Project are
  the system of record** for open work with `00_backlog.md` as the plan
  (`scripts/backlog_issues.py plan|create|rewrite|check`, parser guarded in
  `tests/test_backlog_issues.py`); design note as a PR before code, `Owner:` /
  `Reviewers:` lines on every live note; concurrency rules for `SCHEMA_VERSION`,
  the Imperial digest and case-ID bands ("rebase before you regenerate");
  `.github/CODEOWNERS` (`@Sean074`), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`,
  three issue templates, `docs/10_standard/DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md`; `CLAUDE.md`
  points at them (still ≤160 lines); `.claude/settings.local.json` git-ignored.
  Branch protection and the one-off issue migration are the owner's GitHub steps.

- **Development process simplified: solo profile, PR-fast CI, derived backlog
  table, template placeholder made visible (tier S, 2026-08-17).**
  `DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0 states which note-28 mechanisms are off while the
  repository has one collaborator — PR-per-item, non-author review and the
  issue mirror become optional; one commit per closed item, the backlog row
  leaving in that commit, and every closure tier / rule stay in force — and
  how the full flow switches back on with a second collaborator. **CI:** a
  pull request now runs the fast gate only (`test (3.12)` with coverage,
  `typecheck`, `sbeam-roundtrip (3.12)`); the 3.9/3.11 compatibility legs run
  on push to `main` and are fixed forward; a re-push cancels the run in flight
  (`concurrency`). **Backlog:** the priority table is a *view* of the issues
  under the multi-developer flow — new `scripts/backlog_issues.py render`
  drops closed rows and re-emits open ones from their issue bodies (one
  row-block writer shared with `create`, round-tripped on the live file by
  `tests/test_backlog_issues.py`), so a closing PR never edits the table, rows
  never renumber, and dependencies name the band or `#N`; the eleven "Body
  moved to issue #N" stubs and their two "Item detail" headings are gone.
  Prompted by the first week on 0.6.0: PR #25 merged with the template's
  invisible `#<!-- issue -->` placeholder unfilled, so issue #1 never
  auto-closed; the template now reads `Closes #___` with the rule beside it.

- **Static typing and lint depth (design note 27, tier M, 2026-08-16).** `mypy`
  joins the merge gate: `[tool.mypy]` in `pyproject.toml` checks `sloads/` (never
  `app/`/`tests/`), zero errors in default mode, in its own CI job on 3.12;
  strictness ratchets per package through `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` — stage 1
  (`disallow_untyped_defs`/`disallow_incomplete_defs`/`check_untyped_defs`) on
  the single-source owners (`models/`, `safety_factors`, `units`, `case_ids`,
  `load_keys`, `constants`, `registry`). 153 errors → 0 across 31 files by
  narrowing only (no `type: ignore`, no `Any` widening, no `cast`); the frozen
  Imperial digest and every oracle passed unmodified. Latent `None`
  dereferences on already-refused paths now raise per the error contract
  (`balance.py` `_wing_slices`/`_flight_loads`, `engine.py` `_required`);
  `ConditionResult.note` is `""` not `None` when empty; `GearCaseLoads.case_ref`
  is `Optional[CaseRef]`. `ruff` select widens from `E F W` to
  `E F W B SIM PLE PLW ARG RUF I C4` (each ignore reasoned in `pyproject.toml`;
  `UP` off until 3.9 leaves the matrix, `N`/`PERF` off with reasons); 243 new
  findings → 0, five private helpers lost dead parameters, contract-signature
  `ARG001`s carry a reasoned `noqa`, the two side-effect import blocks are
  isort-skipped in place. Rules of engagement:
  `00_program_overview.md` §Static typing & lint; `CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` step 7.

- **Test-suite runtime, CI speed and git hooks (code-standard review item 8,
  tier S, 2026-08-16).** Measured first: the parallel suite was 59 s locally
  and ~12 min per CI leg. (1) One test —
  `test_imperial_csv_is_byte_identical_to_the_no_system_call` — re-loaded the
  project and re-ran *all* modules once per (example, module) key, ~130 full
  pipeline runs for the same assertion; it now builds the defaults once per
  example. Suite 59 → 36 s locally, no test over 10 s. (2) CI runs branch
  coverage on the **3.12 leg only** (matrix `include`), the 3.9/3.11 legs
  uninstrumented; `--durations=15` on every leg so the next hot spot is visible
  in the log. (3) **No `slow` marker** — deliberately: with the numbers above a
  fast subset saves seconds and adds a thing to keep in step
  (`00_program_overview.md` §Testing states the revisit thresholds).
  (4) `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (opt-in, local hooks on the venv's own tools):
  ruff + mypy on commit, whole suite on push. (5) `ruff` and `mypy` **pinned**
  in `[dev]` (`ruff==0.16.3`, `mypy==2.3.1`) — a newer ruff on the runner than on
  the desk is what turned a green local run into a red PR (RUF068); a bump is
  now a one-line PR whose CI run reviews the new rules. `pre-commit` added to
  `[dev]`; `CONTRIBUTING.md` §2 gains the install line.

- **Backlog priority table re-cut, and the `CgCase` loading decision answered**
  (decision **D-25**; docs only, no code and no output). The order now bands by
  what it protects: wrong content in an already-shipped deliverable first (the
  `LATERAL_AERO_NOTE` `n_y` direction defect, the `applicability` design-weight
  re-point, the `dhc8_dash8` gear carrier tag, M4-22), then the [E] sbeam steps
  12/13/14, then the D-25 wave. The open defects and the unscheduled 0.5.0 review
  findings are **interleaved into the one list** by severity instead of sitting
  only in the index, and the table is renumbered 1–36 (the old Pri 5 gap, left by
  the non-wing-drag step above, is closed). **D-25:** `CgCase` gains an explicit
  loading definition rather than the fixtures' CG-envelope corner points being
  rewritten to suit their weight databases — the corner point is the real
  engineering input; the loading is the derived quantity. It unblocks the two
  sibling coverage findings and is the change that takes the assembled balanced
  deck from 2 fixtures to 6 in CI.

- **Pressurization is out of scope — permanently, and the deliverable now says
  so** (decision **D-24**). The standing limitation read "No pressurization load
  cases.", which an analyst could reasonably take as *not yet*. It now states an
  exclusion: no cabin differential-pressure case (14 CFR 23.365 / 25.365) is
  computed, no pressure load is combined with any flight or ground case, and a
  pressurized fuselage must have that assessment from another source — with the
  unrelated WTESTIMA `pressurized` weight-allowance flag named so the two are not
  confused. Four shipped fixtures are pressurized airplanes, so the sentence
  travels where it matters. Scope follows the wording: **M4-6 (step 10) is the
  ground/landing distributed loads and gear reactions alone**, and **F25-5** keeps
  only its 23.415/25.415 ground-gust half. No calc, no output number and no deck
  byte changes.
- **Imperial digests regenerated, once, deliberately** — three channels on
  `concept_regional_jet` only (`sbeam/vtail_span_cards`, `csv/tail_span`,
  `txt/tail_span`), all of them the T-tail transfer arriving in the one fixture
  whose layout has one. Its fin's own station table (`sbeam/vtail_span_csv`) did
  **not** move, and neither did any other example's anything.
- **Case identity is joinable in the report and the GUI.** A solver result
  labelled `SUBCASE 7105` could be traced back to its condition only through the
  case-index **CSV**; neither the summary report nor any GUI page stated the
  integer at all. The case index (report table and CSV) now carries **two**
  deck-number columns — `LOAD/SUBCASE (component)` and `LOAD/SUBCASE (assembled)`
  — because a case legitimately has one number per deck family (`W-05` is `105`
  in the wing deck and `5105`/`7105`/`8105` in the assembled one, **D-R7**), and
  a single unqualified column would be silently wrong for whichever family it
  was not quoting. Each is filled only where the case is actually in that deck: a
  handed twin fills the assembled column alone, a symmetric case that also
  assembles fills both, and an em dash means "not in that deck". The governing
  loads table (report §Results, the Flight Envelope Critical Loads tab, Results
  Review) and the balanced-case table gained `ID` + `LOAD` columns, and every GUI
  case label now comes from one formatter — `W-03 · LOAD 103 · PHAA · FAR
  23.333(b)` — instead of four independent strings. The number's single owner is
  the new `case_ids.deck_load_id`, drift-guarded against the decks' own text
  (`tests/test_case_ids.py`). The assembled deck's `$` map block now leads with
  the case id, as every other deck family's already did — it was the one deck
  whose comment block could not be joined without reading its case control.
  Design note: `docs/30_future/17_case_load_id_linkage_note.md`.
- **Imperial baseline regenerated — deliberate.** Entering engine horsepower
  moves `csv/txt one_engine_out` and `case_index` on both turboprops (three new
  conditions each), plus **`csv/txt weight_estimate` on `dhc8_dash8`**:
  `resolve_max_continuous_hp` (M2-6) prefers the engine list and had been
  falling back to the stored estimation total, which was 4000 hp against the
  engines' real 2×1950, so the statistical MTOW estimate corrects 42,325 →
  41,775 lb (empty 25,395 → 25,065 lb). `atr42_100`'s stored 3400 already
  matched its 2×1700 and did not move. No load path, deck, oracle or other
  example moved.
- **A wing case row states the flight condition its loads were computed at**
  (**D-23**, backlog priority 1). `wing_case_ref` kept SELECT's `CaseRef`
  *whole* when SELECT had named the condition, so a case that restates its own
  CL/speed shipped rows labelled with a speed its numbers were not built from —
  `atr42_100`'s `PHAA` read 185.85 kt (SELECT's V-n point) beside loads computed
  at the entered 170 kt, and `ga6_normal`'s `ACRL` read 117.4 kt against the
  worked example's 116. The `CaseRef` now takes the case's own `v_eas_kt`
  wherever it states one — the same precedence `net_loads._air_cl_v` computes
  the air load by — so the wing CSVs, the case index and the report agree on one
  speed per case. **SELECT's `case_id` is kept** (M4-2 decision 1: one ID per
  physical condition, which the case-index dedupe assumes), as are CG, altitude
  and the FAR reference, which the case does not state; SELECT's own
  governing-loads row keeps its V-n point, which is what *its* numbers were
  computed at. The case index's ordering rule is now explicit and stated in
  `case_index_rows_from` — deck-exported results before SELECT's conditions,
  first-seen defines a row's condition — with the four callers (report, Export
  page, workbook, baseline) put in that order and a drift guard on it
  (`tests/test_case_ids.py::test_the_index_row_states_the_condition_its_cards_were_computed_at`).
  No load number, card, deck or oracle moved.
- **Imperial baseline regenerated — deliberate (wing case conditions).** Three
  channels move on all six examples: `csv/wing_inertia` and `csv/net_loads` (the
  Speed column on the cases that restate their condition) and `case_index` (the
  same speeds, plus the row order the caller change implies). No `sbeam/*` deck
  channel moved — the identity changed, the numbers did not.
- **Imperial baseline regenerated again — deliberate (case-identity linkage).**
  `case_index` moves on all six examples (two new columns) and
  `sbeam/balanced_deck` on the two that assemble (the case id added to the map
  block's comment lines). No load number, card value, oracle or other channel
  moved.

---

### Fixed

- **Constants and conversion factors — one owner, one value, one rule (issue #26, review 2026-08-17 C-1…C-12, tier M, 2026-08-17).**
  `sloads/constants.py` now owns every shared physical constant and suite-internal
  (Imperial↔Imperial) factor — `DEG_PER_RAD`/`RAD_PER_DEG`, `IN_PER_FT`, `IN2_PER_FT2`,
  `KT_TO_FPS`, `FT_LB_S_PER_HP` (→ `HP_TO_TORQUE`), `dynamic_pressure_psf`/
  `eas_from_dynamic_pressure`, `gust_alleviation_factor` + `GUST_LOAD_FACTOR_DIVISOR`
  (FAR 23.341(c)) — and the ~60 open-coded sites (`57.3`, `114.6`, `_G = 32.2`, six
  `144` aliases, `/12.0`, `550`, `V²/295` ×16, the gust triple ×5) read it; the
  `PI`/`TWO_PI` aliases are gone (`math.pi` everywhere). **Exact by default:** 57.3,
  32.2, 295 and FLTLOADS' private 518.688 °R speed of sound go to their exact owners
  (measured: no printed oracle moves; digest and SELECT/dCD/VA-VF self-pins re-pinned,
  register line in `02_approved_corrections.md`); `KT_TO_FPS_SUITE` survives for `VSF`
  only (ENGLOADS `/101.2` oracle). The `constants.py` (Imperial↔Imperial) vs `units.py`
  (Imperial↔SI only) demarcation is written into `CONVENTIONS.md` §7 with grep drift
  guards both ways (`tests/test_constants.py`); UI help text quotes `√(2(W/S)/(ρ₀·CLmax))`.

- **No silent defaults in the export namespace (CH-2, code-standard review item
  9, tier M, 2026-08-16).** Seven `getattr(obj, name, default)` reads in
  `sloads/export/sbeam_bridge.py` — the shape the error contract forbids
  ("flagged, never silently defaulted") — are gone: `case_ref`, `case`,
  `tip_transfer` and `hand` are declared fields on every exportable result and
  are now read as the typed attributes they are (`_sid`, `subcase_map`,
  `_tail_span_case_block`, the case-index builder, where the assembled case's
  `hand` is **passed** to `add()` and a component-deck item takes the bare id by
  statement, not by a probe that happened to miss); the one lookup by name (the
  `htail`/`vtail` span slice in `_tail_span_results`) is an explicit map that
  refuses an unknown component with a `ValueError` instead of reading as "no
  loads". Frozen Imperial digest unchanged — no default was ever being taken on
  a fixture, which is what makes this hygiene rather than a load change. Guards:
  `tests/test_sbeam_bridge.py::test_the_export_package_takes_no_silent_defaults`
  (AST walk over `sloads/export/`, three-argument `getattr` forbidden; the
  two-argument dynamic-name form stays allowed) and
  `::test_tail_span_export_refuses_an_unknown_component`. `00_program_overview.md`
  §Error handling and `PROGRAM_SPEC.md` §Export bridges state the rule;
  `CONVENTIONS.md` §7 gains the row; CH-2 struck from backlog row 5 (issue #5's
  remaining clauses stay open).

- **The fin-root "fuselage-top" formula has a body-centreline datum (backlog
  Pri 1, defect from T-8a, tier M, 2026-08-16).**
  `tail_geometry.fin_root_waterline`'s fuselage-top branch was
  `root_waterline_z + fuselage_height/2`, which reads the **wing** root as the
  body centreline — the substitution `CONVENTIONS.md`'s body-drag row refuses
  for D-1 — and on the three high-wing outline fixtures stacked half a body
  above the real top. With a fuselage outline present the branch is now
  **`z_centre(x_fin) + height(x_fin)/2`**: the v52 section-centre line
  (`derived_geometry.fuselage_centreline`, note 24 R-4) plus half the **local**
  body height (new sibling owner `derived_geometry.fuselage_height_at`), both
  at the fin's `xv25`. The old formula survives only as the no-outline fallback
  and its note now names the wing-root substitution it makes; a pointed tail
  cone (zero local height at `x_fin`) declines the branch rather than seating a
  fin on nothing. The new project-level resolver `tail_geometry.fin_root`
  is read by both the load path and the three-view
  (`configuration.tail_planform` gained an optional `project` argument), so the
  single-owner guard holds. **Re-pins (the un-pinning the backlog row
  promised):** fin roots `atr42_100` 223.15 → 191.17 in, `dhc8_dash8` 232.95 →
  203.45, `cessna_210` 109.60 → 100.24 (`ga6_normal` — no outline — and the
  T-tail regional jet unchanged); the twelve lateral-case pins moved in `p_dot`
  (roll arm) and slightly in `r_dot` (`Ixz` coupling) with fin load and `n_y`
  byte-identical; the Imperial digest baseline regenerated deliberately for the
  three fixtures' `balance`/`tail_span`/vtail cards and decks (plus a
  note-text-only move on `ga6_normal`'s fin deck header).

- **Hygiene batch — one authority for σ, ρ₀ and every SI display factor; the
  guards that were claimed to exist now exist (backlog Pri 5, tier S, 2026-08-17).**
  Closes the 2026-08-05 conventions-extraction findings (a)–(d), M4-23, CH-3, CH-6,
  CH-7 and the 427 lb fuselage-mass pin in one change. **(a)** `tests/test_load_keys.py`
  written — `LoadValue` keys unique within every `ConditionResult`, every module ×
  every example project (verified zero duplicates before writing). **(b)**
  `constants.py`/`models/results.py` cite "14 CFR 23.303 / 25.303", the SF
  authority's phrasing. **(c)** already carried the comment. **(d)** the three
  partially-shared SI factor maps consolidated: `units.HUMAN_SI` is the one owner
  (every factor a named constant, products derived — `FT2_TO_M2`, `IN2_TO_M2`,
  `HP_TO_KW`, `SLUG_FT2_TO_KG_M2 = FT_LB_TO_N_M`); `SI_PER_IMPERIAL`,
  `UNIT_LABELS`, `_RESULT_TO_SI`, `_SI_BY_QUANTITY`, `_SCALAR_TO_SI`,
  `_KIND_FACTORS` are views built by `_view()`, no call site moved; **CH-7**
  `report/content._EXTRA_DIMENSIONS` takes its four factors from it (labels stay
  the report's ASCII ones, so no deliverable byte moved). **CH-6** `constants.RHO_SL`
  replaces the eight `0.002378` literals under three private names; **M4-23**
  `flight_envelope.density_ratio` now returns `standard_atmosphere(alt)[1]` and
  keeps only FLTLOADS' own speed of sound. **CH-3** `tests/test_tail_transforms.py`
  tests the three empennage maps directly against `CONVENTIONS.md` §7, with the fin
  torsion sign recomputed as `r × F` rather than asserted. **427 lb pin retired as
  superseded** — verified: no FAR23 oracle module reads `fuselage_mass`; `body_loads`
  builds its beam from `weight.items` via B1's `fuselage_beam_stations`, and
  `mass_distribution.fuselage_reconciliation` (+ `test_mass_distribution`) is the
  standing guard on the entered table. The review-§1.7 `[Unreleased]` currency check
  is out of scope: `[Unreleased]` is build-generated from `changes/` since 2026-08-16.
  Guards: `test_constants.py` (ρ₀ literal has one owner; σ delegated),
  `test_units.py::test_every_si_view_reads_the_one_owner` /
  `::test_si_factor_literals_have_one_owner`; `CONVENTIONS.md` §7 gains the two owner
  rows, §8 is closed. Suite, digests and oracles unchanged.

- **Analysis-page LIMIT CSVs follow the unit toggle and label their units (L-8i,
  backlog Pri 3, tier S, 2026-08-16).** The Wing/Fuselage/Tail Loads pages built
  their LIMIT download inline from the raw Imperial row dicts, so an SI session
  downloaded Imperial numbers under unit-less headers while the table above was
  converted — the units-defect class M4-20 already paid for. New `app/limit_csv.py`
  is the one owner per page of the column→unit map, the display conversion and the
  unit-suffixed header (`Fz (lbf)`/`Fz (N)`, `Mxx (lb-in)`/`Mxx (N·m)`, tail
  `PSI(Xn) (psi, LIMIT)`/`(kPa, LIMIT)`), and feeds **both** the on-screen table and
  the download so they cannot disagree; the two hand-authored tail header sets
  collapse into one. Decisions: map stays per page (the row builders return
  pre-formatted strings with no quantity kind); units in the headers and basis in
  the `Basis` column / `*_LIMIT.csv` filename, **no** `units_statement` line — the
  LIMIT analysis-page carve-out, not a deliverable (`CONVENTIONS.md` §3). On review
  `loads_plots` was already converted and labels units in its `Field` cell, so it
  is verified conformant and unchanged (the issue's "four pages" is three). The
  sbeam/export channel is untouched. Guard: `tests/test_limit_csv.py` (Imperial in
  → Imperial out, SI cells equal `to_si_scalar` of the Imperial ones, no bare load
  header in either system).

- **LRA deck: one `PBAR`/`MAT1` pair per section family, editable in place
  (backlog Pri 7 / #7 — step 14 descoped, tier S, 2026-08-17).** The LRA
  model wrote a single placeholder pair that every `CBAR` referenced; a
  sizing tool with real sections had nowhere to put them. The deck now
  carries four pairs — `wing` / `fuselage` / `htail` / `vtail`
  (`lra_model.SECTION_FAMILIES`, `MID = PID` 1–4, each tagged
  `$ SLOADS-SECTION <family>`), the left wing sharing the right's and the
  fwd/aft fuselage chains one — with **identical placeholder values** in all
  four (a different default per family would be invented stiffness and would
  move the indeterminate paths for no reason), and every `CBAR` carries its
  family's PID. Decision of record (user, 2026-08-17): **no input path** —
  not the review's "consumer-supplied" sidecar/schema, because section
  properties are the sizing half's output (scope review §2.3), so the seam is
  the deck a sizing tool edits, not `sloads`' schema; the 0.6.0 freeze holds
  at v53. `STIFFNESS_NOTE` rewritten to say which cards to overwrite. Solved
  results unchanged (same numbers, new IDs); guard
  `test_lra_model.py::test_every_cbar_references_its_family_section_and_the_four_pairs_are_identical`;
  round-trip leg still solves; Imperial digest regenerated on `sbeam/lra_model`
  for the four fixtures that export one.

- **A forward non-wing "drag" is no longer applied where the polar is not
  trusted (backlog Pri 2, fixture aero-data defect, tier M, 2026-08-17).**
  Design note 20 D-4 revised (§8.2): the airplane-less-tail polar less the wing
  strips (`balance.body_axial_set`) is a physical `body-axial` load only where
  both drag models are trusted, and the trim `α` is now tested against a
  **one-sided** window, the single owner `constants.POLAR_TRUSTED_ALPHA_DEG =
  (−10°, +15°)` (`balance.polar_alpha_trusted`, read by the code and by the G10
  gate). Outside it a forward difference is **not applied** — no card,
  `body_axial = 0`, new result flag `BalancedCaseResult.body_axial_clamped`, the
  raw value and the window in the case note — while `ΔC_D` is still reported
  unclamped, so the diagnostic that found the defect keeps its signal. Inside
  the window a forward value is a fixture-data defect and fails G10; the three
  excused `NMAA` entries the test carried are gone. What this removes from the
  decks: **1,004 / 1,097 / 1,445 lb forward** on `atr42_100` / `dhc8_dash8` /
  `concept_heavy` `NMAA` (α = −12.9…−14.3°, 3–8 % of `W`) and the regional
  jet's four high-`α` cases (1.7–2.6 klb). Stated consequence: on those cases
  and only those, both pre-closure residuals re-open by the un-applied force
  and its couple about the CG (pitch **1.5–2.1 %** of `n·W·MAC` on the three
  `NMAA` points, the wing plane being ~40 in from the CG), reacted by the
  closure and pinned per case in `test_balance.py::_CLAMPED_BODY_AXIAL` under a
  2.5 % hard stop; G1/G5 and G2 read the same flag. `ga6_normal`, `cessna_210`
  and every in-window case are byte-identical. Imperial digest regenerated for
  the four fixtures' `balance` channels and three `lra_model` channels; polars
  not re-derived (out of scope by the row's own words).

- **One-engine-out refuses non-propeller installations (M4-3(b), issue #4, tier S, 2026-08-16).**
  `one_engine_out._case_inputs` raises `MissingInputError` when the failed engine
  has no propeller diameter, so `run`, `time_history` and the UI page all refuse
  instead of simulating with a 0-in windmilling disc; `PROPELLER_ONLY_NOTE` now
  states the enforcement. The gate is the propeller disc rather than
  `engine_type` — `EngineType` has no turbofan member (a fan is entered as `T`
  with a 0-in disc) and the schema is frozen. Reciprocating twins still run;
  the turboprop scope of 23.367(a) stays a coverage-table statement.
  Guard: `tests/test_one_engine_out.py::test_no_propeller_disc_is_refused`.
  (a)/(c) remain parked. Closes #4.

- **CI red on every `main` run since step 12: platform-dependent bytes in the
  frozen Imperial digest and the 3.9 data dictionary (tier M, 2026-08-16).**
  Two classes, both invisible locally (macOS, Python 3.11) and red on the Linux
  matrix: (a) `select.py` picked critical cases with `max()`/`min()` over keys
  that tie *exactly* in exact arithmetic — `BAL A` at two altitudes carries the
  same VA — but land one ulp apart on another libm (and under 3.12's
  compensated `sum()`), so `atr42_100`'s SUDDEN RUDDER came from V-n 74 in CI
  and V-n 14 on the Mac; every keyed pick now goes through **`_extreme`**, first-
  in-order inside a `_TIE_REL` (1e-9 relative) band, which is exactly what
  `max` returned for a bit-exact tie, so no local pick moved. (b) FORCE/MOMENT
  components that are zero by construction printed their ~1e-14 cancellation
  residue (`6.101335E-15` here, `1.987480E-14` there) or `-0.000000E+00`;
  every vector card (FORCE, MOMENT, GRID, CONM2 offset — 26 sites across five
  exporters) now formats through **`sbeam_bridge._fmt3`**, which snaps a
  component below `_TOL ×` its own card's scale to `0.000000E+00` (the
  per-component form of `_closed`). Digest regenerated: every one of the 23,649
  changed lines is `-0` → `0` or dust → `0`, no load value moved. (c) With (a)
  and (b) in, the 3.12 leg alone still failed on `concept_regional_jet`: Python
  3.12 changed the built-in `sum()` of floats to compensated summation, so
  `resultant6`'s `sum(ld.fz …)` landed a few ulp from 3.9/3.11 and two values
  sat on print boundaries (an integer-valued residual `65013` vs `6.501e+04`;
  a FORCE card's 7th digit). **Every float summation in `sloads/` — 102 sites
  in 20 files — is now `math.fsum`**, exactly rounded and therefore identical
  on every interpreter and platform; the digest moved by 20 lines, all
  last-digit, and every oracle/closure pin passed unmodified. Also
  `docs/generate_data_dict.py` drops the `"An enumeration."` placeholder that
  Python ≤ 3.10's `EnumMeta` stamps into a docstring-less enum's own `__dict__`
  (the 3.9-only `DATA_DICTIONARY.md is stale` failure). New guards
  `tests/test_select.py::test_extreme_pick_is_first_in_order_across_a_platform_ulp_tie`,
  `tests/test_sbeam_bridge.py::test_card_components_snap_dust_and_negative_zero`
  and `tests/test_platform_stability.py::test_every_float_summation_in_sloads_is_fsum`
  (all grep for bypasses); `CONVENTIONS.md` §7 gains the row.

- **`atr42_100`/`dhc8_dash8` are T-tails, and are now modelled as such
  (backlog Pri 1, from T-8a, tier M, 2026-08-16).** Both fixtures set
  `tail_type: t_tail` (their own `xt25`/`xv25` were the tell); the fin root
  stays on the outline datum (`h_tail_z` left `0`, so the just-closed
  fuselage-top branch governs: atr42 191.2 in, dhc8 203.5 in — unchanged), and
  the horizontal tail now attaches at the fin tip. Consequences in the
  deliverables: every fin case on both airplanes carries the **T7 tip
  transfer** (the concurrent balancing h-tail load plus h-tail inertia at the
  fin's last `GRID` — a load that was missing, not merely absent), the h-tail
  beam has the single fin-tip joint instead of a fuselage-side pair, and the
  LRA model ties the h-tail centreline to the fin tip. Two same-class sweeps
  (rule 4): the h-tail's **stations sit on the fin tip** on any T-tail
  (`tail_span._h_tail_waterline` read the wing root waterline regardless of
  layout — 146–180 in low on every T-tail fixture including
  `concept_regional_jet`; no load moves, the h-tail carries `fz` only, but the
  `GRID`s and the fin-tip joint were at the wrong waterline), and the
  three-view's defaulted T-tail/cruciform h-tail is drawn on the *resolved*
  fin (`fin_root + span`) instead of `fuselage_height/2 + span` above the wing
  root (32 in apart on atr42). Also rides this digest wave: the tail-span CSV
  `Fax`/`Sax` columns no longer print `-0.00` (a negated zero by construction,
  180 rows per h-tail CSV on every fixture) — the `-0.000000E+00` card half of
  the old Pri 13 was already closed by `_fmt3`. Imperial digest regenerated for
  the two twins' tail/balanced/LRA channels and `concept_regional_jet`'s
  h-tail/LRA channels; the negative-zero guard
  (`test_export_equilibrium.py::test_the_body_deliverables_never_render_a_negative_zero`)
  now covers the tail-span decks; the two tests that used atr42 as the
  conventional-with-outline example run on `cessna_210` / a reset layout.

- **Wing-tank fuel no longer rides both beams — `MassItem.wing_fraction`
  (backlog Pri 6 / #6, design note 29, tier L, 2026-08-17; schema **v53**, the
  0.6.0 freeze's one hop, additive with a `0.0` default, no migration hop).**
  On `atr42_100`, `dhc8_dash8` and `concept_heavy` the wing-tank fuel sat inside
  an undivided `"Fuel to gross"` row tagged `fuselage` while WINGINER's
  `concentrated` hung the same 3,800 / 4,000 / 1,200 lb on the wing — 11.6 /
  14.5 / 7.4 % of the derived body beam, above the base-method band, so every
  body inertia load, shear, bending moment and carry-through reaction on those
  fixtures was over-stated by `n ×` those pounds while the wing deck relieved
  with them, and the assembled case carried the fuel as body inertia with no
  wing relief. A row now states the fraction of its weight (and own inertias)
  the wing reacts; the remainder stays on `component`; both parts sit at the
  row's position, so WTONECG/WTENV/`cg_cases`/every derived `CaseLoading` are
  bit-identical (they read rows). One owner, `mass_distribution.reacted_parts`,
  turns rows into parts for `distribution()`, `balance` (wing/body inertia,
  self-inertia, body-drag fallback) and the CONM2 header; a drift guard pins
  that they agree. Fixture fractions are derived from WINGINER's own entries
  (3800/9174, 4000/4660, 1200/5500 — no number invented); the per-fixture
  "unmodelled wing mass" pin is deleted and survives as the reduction gate
  (strip the fraction, exactly those pounds reappear). The wing tie is now a
  validator (`wing_mass_tie_open`, both signs, with the remedy) plus two entry
  rules (`wing_fraction_out_of_range`, `wing_fraction_on_wing_row`). Measured
  consequences, all on the three fixtures only: body beams 32,751 → 28,951 /
  27,500 → 23,500 / 16,200 → 15,000 lb; wing-inertia scale 1.898 → 3.332 /
  2.333 → 3.667 / 1.000 → 1.667; and — the one effect the note did not predict
  in size — `Izz(closure)` **+33 / +31 / +29 %** because the fuel left the
  centreline lump for WINGINER's spanwise spread, so the twins' yaw and roll
  accelerations under the same fin load fell by a quarter to a third (fin load
  and `Ny` unchanged — inertia moved, not aero). Imperial digest regenerated
  for exactly those fixtures on the body / balance / LRA channels; every wing
  deck, every CONM2 card and every other fixture byte-unchanged; Appendix A
  untouched. `dhc8_dash8`'s hand-entered station table (25,890 lb) now
  *exceeds* the derived beam by 2,390 lb — it was written with the fuel on the
  body — and is pinned as such.

- **Flight Envelope: the SELECT Apply no longer persists un-applied geometry
  edits** (backlog **M4-22**). The "SELECT search inputs" form handler wrote the
  page's *probe* copy of the project back to session state, and that copy carries
  the live merge of the sidebar's "Apply geometry & altitudes" widgets — so
  pressing **Apply** inside the SELECT expander silently committed whatever the
  user had typed into that other form (tail CP stations XTC/XTF, the reference
  Mach, the altitudes editor) without its own Apply ever being pressed. The
  handler now writes only `select_input`, onto the session project, restoring the
  M2-3 "persist only on Apply" contract for both forms. New headless
  `AppTest` guard `tests/test_flight_envelope_view.py` pins both directions; the
  probe-copy pattern exists on this page alone.

- **The Dash 8's wing-carried main gear was fuselage mass in both mass models**
  (backlog Pri 1, decision **G-2**; the guard `gear_carrier_mass_disagrees`
  shipped 2026-08-14 and this is the correction it was written to force). The
  fixture states `main_gear.carrier = wing` — the leg sits in the wing-mounted
  nacelle — while the 1,200 lb `Main gear` item was tagged `fuselage` and
  WINGINER's `wing_mass.concentrated` listed only engine+nacelle and fuel: the
  same structure carried the ground load but not the weight, so the body beam
  carried 1,200 lb it does not hold and the wing lost the inertia relief of its
  own gear. The item is now tagged `wing` and a 600 lb/side `main gear`
  concentrated mass (BL 75, the trunnion butt line, at the item's own station)
  joins the wing model, so both models describe one airplane: the wing tie's gap
  stays **4,000 lb = wing-tank fuel alone** (up 1,200 on each side of the tie),
  and the "each gap has one cause" reading of
  `mass_distribution.unmodelled_wing_mass` survives. Dash 8 wing inertia moves as
  the physics says — root `Sz` −18,320 → −20,570 lb-ULT (exactly the leg's
  2,250 lb-ULT per side), `Mxx` −3.375e6 → −3.515e6, `Myy` 0.993e5 → 1.286e5
  lb-in-ULT — and the relief reaches the deliverable: net wing root shear
  50,400 → 48,150 lb-ULT (−4.5 %) and root bending 1.070e7 → 1.056e7 lb-in-ULT.
  Ten Imperial channels re-pinned on that fixture alone (an intended digest
  wave); the gear now brackets a second offset-couple node (BL 75 is inboard of
  the engine and fuel at BL 168/180), pinned per fixture in
  `test_offset_couples_exist_only_where_a_concentrated_mass_does`. No shipped
  fixture fires the carrier/mass guard now, and a new test re-mistags the leg to
  prove it still would.
- **The FAR 23 applicability gate read the item-database total as the design
  weight** (decision **G-14**'s deferred half; `WeightInput.direct_totals()` is
  renamed `database_totals()`). `applicability.design_weight_lb` took
  `speeds.weight_lb` when set and otherwise the *sum of every weight-database
  row* — an upper bound wearing the name of a design limit, since a database can
  hold full fuel **and** full payload at once (964 lb above MTOW on `atr42_100`,
  1,800 lb on `concept_regional_jet`). It now reads the MTOW SSOT through
  `cg_cases.max_takeoff_weight`, so the certification gate and every other
  consumer take the same number, and the database total — the *ceiling* of
  `OEW ≤ MLW ≤ MTOW ≤ Σ items`, owned by `cg_cases.database_total` — is no longer
  reachable from it.

  **Correcting the record:** the backlog, plan 18 §G-14 and the 2026-08-14
  history entry all state this moves the exceedance line 37,781 → 36,817 on
  atr42 and 34,800 → 33,000 on the RJ. Measured 2026-08-15, **it does not**:
  both fixtures set `speeds.weight_lb`, which won ahead of the database branch,
  so the gate already read the right number on all six fixtures. The defect was
  **latent** — live only for a project whose STRSPEED design weight is unset,
  i.e. one caught mid-entry, exactly when the banner is first consulted.

  Swept in the same change (practice 4), same defect class: the read-throughs on
  Structural Speeds and Weight & Mass Properties now offer the MTOW SSOT instead
  of the database total; Aircraft Comparison plots MTOW through its single owner
  rather than a weight no loading can reach; and the report's weights table row
  labelled **"Maximum takeoff weight (item sum)"** becomes two honest rows —
  "Maximum takeoff weight (MTOW)" from the SSOT and "Item database total
  (ceiling, not MTOW)". `test_design_weight_is_the_mtow_ssot_and_never_the_database_total`
  pins the *fallback*, where the defect lived, not just the happy path.
  Digest: `txt/weight_estimate` on the four concept fixtures (the concept note
  names the renamed method); no numeric channel moved.

- **`LATERAL_AERO_NOTE` stated the `n_y` error in the wrong direction** (defect
  found 2026-08-15 while writing the L-7 design note; text only — no computed
  number moves). The in-band lateral caveat shipped with B8a-3 told every reader
  that `n_y` *and* the yaw acceleration were **over-stated** and that the inertia
  they drive was therefore conservative. The yaw half is right — the missing body
  yawing couple is destabilizing and opposes the fin's — but the `n_y` half was
  backwards: at `+β` the missing body-and-wing side force acts the **same** way
  as the fin's restoring load, so it **adds**, `|n_y|` is **under**-stated, and
  the lateral translational inertia is **not** conservative. The sentence now
  states a direction **per degree of freedom**; both magnitudes stay *unknown* in
  band, because the measured figures (`docs/30_future/19_l7_lateral_body_aero_note.md`
  §7: `|n_y|` 4.1–12.0 % low on `concept_regional_jet`) come from a scratch run
  no shipped code reproduces, and a deck-header number must be one this tool can
  produce — quoting them stays part of backlog L-7. Corrected at every carrier:
  `balance.LATERAL_AERO_NOTE` (quoted verbatim by `report/methods.py`, so the
  report, the deck `$` header, the case notes and the UI follow), the
  `balance` module docstring, `CONVENTIONS.md` §1's L-7 bullet and
  `PROGRAM_SPEC.md`'s two lateral bullets. New
  `tests/test_methods_stamp.py::test_the_lateral_caveat_states_a_direction_per_degree_of_freedom`
  pins the two directions **separately**, since one sentence covering both is
  what got it wrong. Digest: `sbeam/balanced_deck` and `txt/balance` on the two
  fixtures with lateral cases (`ga6_normal`, `concept_regional_jet`); Imperial
  baseline regenerated, no numeric channel moved.

- **The balanced cases' pitch residual was attributed to two causes that the
  measurement refutes** (backlog Pri 5, the element-count study that item asked
  for; documentation and diagnosis only, no calc changed). Sweeping
  `SurfaceInput.elements` 5 → 640 shows the pitch residual converging by ~20
  elements onto a **non-zero plateau** (RJ PLAA 1.041 %, TORS 1.174 %, SIDE GUST
  1.586 %, flat to three decimals), which rules out the strip-quadrature lift
  floor (plan 11 R3). An exact three-term identity — derived by subtracting
  `flight_envelope._balance` from the assembled sum, where `wing_about_ac`
  cancels against `fuselage_cm` and the wing/body inertia moments cancel — then
  closes to the last printed digit on every case and shows the residual is
  `(zw − zcg)·(ΣFx_wing − dx)` almost in full: **the assembled model carries no
  non-wing drag**. The lift term never exceeds 0.086 % and the tail-station term
  is exactly zero on a clean configuration. M4-19 is ruled out on structural
  grounds as well as measured ones — `fuselage-cm` is a *free couple*, so no
  redistribution of it can change the resultant. The same missing load is the
  whole of the `nx` gap (ga6 PHAA closure 0.661 g against the trim's 0.610;
  `residual_fx` equals `ΣFx_wing` exactly), also element-independent. Backlog
  Pri 5 is re-titled "non-wing drag has no carrier in the assembled model", its
  superseded hypothesis marked rather than deleted, and its M4-19 pairing
  dropped. Corrected in `balance` (module and `_closure` docstrings),
  `report/content.py`'s over-the-gate message, `PROGRAM_SPEC.md`,
  `balanced_cases.md` and `theory_sources.md`.

- **"Strip quadrature" was the wrong name for the force-residual floor too**
  (same study; swept alongside the above per `CLAUDE.md` practice 4). The `Fz`
  residual also converges to a non-zero plateau — ga6 PHAA **−42.3 lb / 0.327 %**
  at 640 elements, against the −34.6 lb / 0.268 % seen at the default 20, which
  is that floor partly cancelled by the quadrature transient. Plan 11 R3's
  *identification* stands (strip lift integral vs the trim's closed-form
  `CL·q·S`); only the name was wrong, and it is now stated as a model difference
  with the converged number beside the default-element one.

- **The lumped fuselage `Cm` was documented as a small positive constant**
  (found by the same study). It is a slope term and **changes sign with `α`**:
  measured across every fixture case, −6.6 to +4.9 % of `n·W·MAC` on
  `ga6_normal` (the negative-`α` `NMAA` point) and −8.5 to +5.8 % on
  `concept_regional_jet`. The shipped "+4.3 to +6.3 %, positive (destabilising)"
  reading was taken over the symmetric wing conditions only and did not survive
  the negative-`α` and lateral points. Corrected in the five live sources that
  quoted it (`balance.py`, `PROGRAM_SPEC.md`, `balanced_cases.md`,
  `theory_sources.md`); the `40_history` and plan-13 copies are left as the
  record of what was measured at the time.

- **A ground case's LANDLOAD case number was printed as a "V-n point"**
  (0.6.0-candidate review finding **R6-C3**). `BalancedCaseResult.vn_case`
  carries the case's **source** case number, and the ground family's comes from
  LANDLOAD's 1–33 table rather than FLTLOADS' V-n envelope — but every surface
  that printed it used the flight family's wording, so "V-n point 19" on
  LANDLOAD case 19 sent a reader to a **real and unrelated** flight point: the
  silent-wrong-join class design note 17's case identity exists to prevent.
  The wording now has one owner, `balance.source_case_name` (family read off
  `is_ground`, with `case_source_name` for an assembled case), and all five
  surfaces the review named go through it: the assembled deck's `$` case header
  (`-- LANDLOAD case 19,`) and case map, `run()`'s condition titles, the
  balanced-case rows table — whose column is now headed **`Source case`** with a
  family-aware value, since the header itself claimed a table the row might not
  belong to — and `SkippedCondition.name`, which gained a `ground` field so the
  record states its own family rather than inferring it. Swept in the same
  change (CLAUDE.md practice 4): the shared `no-cg-case` skip reason, which the
  ground family also reaches, now says "its **source case** names a loading this
  project does not define"; and the Balanced Cases page's selector, which
  labelled a ground case's drift-direction hand a "roll". **Display wording
  only** — no case identity, number, load or `CaseRef` changed. The new owner is
  registered in the `CONVENTIONS.md` §7 single-source table with its guard,
  `tests/test_balance.py::test_no_surface_calls_a_ground_case_a_v_n_point`,
  which checks all five surfaces on every fixture that assembles ground cases
  and pins the flight wording in the same breath. **Digest wave:**
  `txt/balance`, `csv/balance` and `sbeam/balanced_deck` on the two fixtures
  with ground cases (`ga6_normal`, `concept_regional_jet`) — six hashes, one
  channel wider than the backlog row declared, because two of the five surfaces
  are in the assembled deck; no other channel or fixture moved.

- **The gear report CSV did not meet the load-output contract's column rules**
  (0.6.0-candidate review finding **R6-C2**, with the **R6-C4** hygiene items
  folded in per the backlog pairing). The G-12 companion file carried no unit
  on any force/moment column — and therefore no `-ULT` marker anywhere in the
  table — no per-case `SF` column, and in SI showed a millimetre value under a
  hard-coded `Stroke (in)` header, because no test read the SI gear CSV at all.
  The header row is now built from the resolved unit set
  (`_gear_report_headers`): every dimensional column states its unit, load
  columns carry `-ULT` (`lbs-ULT`/`lb-in-ULT`, `N-ULT`/`Nmm-ULT`), the two
  weights (inputs, never factored) carry the plain force unit, and `SF` is the
  last column on every row, per the F-R1 rule. The row dicts keep bare,
  system-independent keys — only the file header carries units. New `Wheel`
  column says which wheel a `main` row describes (starboard of the pair; the
  port twin is the mirror), previously said only in a code comment (R6-C4);
  the other two R6-C4 items landed byte-neutral (`balance.gear_sets` dropped
  its unused `nvp` parameter; `_gear_stroke_table`'s docstring paste blemish
  removed). Digest wave: `gear_report` on the five gear fixtures, exactly as
  declared — nothing else moved. Pinned both ways: an Imperial header/SF/Wheel
  contract test, and the SI-channel assertion whose absence let the defect ship
  (header labels plus one converted value per dimension).
- **Ground condition rows cited FAR 23.321, the flight balancing reference**
  (0.6.0-candidate review finding **R6-C1**). `balance.run()` derived every
  non-lateral, non-unsymmetrical row's regulation from the flight literals, so
  all up-to-27 assembled ground conditions rendered with 23.321 in the module
  result, the load-case CSV and the Results Review page — while the case's own
  `CaseRef` (which the deck map, case index and gear report flow through)
  correctly said 23.479(a)/23.481/23.483/23.485/23.493. A ground row now cites
  its `CaseRef`'s reference (fallback 23.471, the family's general sentence);
  the symmetric flight families deliberately keep their literals, because their
  `CaseRef`s name the V-n envelope source (23.333) while the *balancing* of
  that point is 23.321's requirement. The safety factor never moved (flight and
  ground families both derive 1.5, now classified under the right family row).
  Digest wave: `txt/csv balance` on the two ground fixtures, exactly as the
  backlog row declared. Pinned per fixture: every ground row's FAR equals its
  `CaseRef`'s, and every flight row still reads 23.321/23.349.
- **The loading named on LANDLOAD cases 20–24 was the wrong one.** The per-case
  record indexed the three roled loadings as `(m - 1) % 3` for every case up to
  24, but the 23.485 side family is three loadings × **two drift directions** —
  which the `WL` weight table and both unbalanced-moment tables already say
  (`wl[19] = wl[20] = wcg[0]·wr`). So five of the six side cases were reported
  against the wrong loading: case 21 is computed at *fwd max landing* and was
  labelled *fwd light*. `cg_name` was documented as cosmetic and the reactions
  themselves were always right, so **no load ever moved**; what moved is the label
  a reader joins a case to its loading by, and the `CG` column of the exported
  case index. Found while building the assembled ground cases, which have to
  build their inertia set at the loading their reactions were computed at.
  `landing._loading_index` is now the single owner of that mapping.
- **`is_handed` read "any load carries a free moment" where it meant the net.**
  Indistinguishable while the aileron couple was the suite's only free `mx` (one
  lumped couple at the centreline is its own net), and wrong the moment a ground
  case transferred both main-wheel reactions to their trunnions with equal and
  opposite lever-arm couples: every symmetric level-landing case minted handed,
  emitting a twin that was the same load set mirrored onto itself. No shipped
  flight case changes hand.
- **Documentation currency batch** (0.6.0-candidate review findings
  **R6-D1/D2/D3/D4**, `docs/50_reviews/2026-08-15_review_0_6_0_candidate.md`):
  this changelog's `[Unreleased]` headings restored to Keep-a-Changelog order
  (five `Added`-class entries had been filed under `### Fixed`); the backlog's
  "shipped since the tag" narrative gains step 9 and D-24, which a release-notes
  drafter working from it would otherwise have dropped; plan 09's status header
  now says T6–T8 shipped (it read "T6–T8 remain" against the history file); and
  `docs/00_INDEX.md` gains rows for design notes 14 and 18 (the latter is the
  0.6.0 headline's decision record). Documentation only — no code, no digest.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-13

### Release notes — what a 0.5.0 deck does and does not carry

0.5.0 makes the **assembled full-span free-free airplane deck** the primary
loads deliverable: aero and inertia together, left and right hands, a CONM2
mass model beside it, and global equilibrium proved continuously in CI. Four
standing caveats govern how far a deck from this release can be carried. Each
travels in band — on the deck's `$` header, the case notes and the report's
methods & limitations section — so this list is a summary, not the source.

- **The fuselage deck is flight-only.** No ground reaction, landing or
  pressurization case is distributed onto the body; the ground/landing families
  are the 0.6.0 headline (decision **D-R3**). A body deck from 0.5.0 sizes
  flight cases and nothing else.
- **Lateral aerodynamics are fin-only (decision L-7).** The fin's own side load
  is the only lateral aerodynamic force the suite computes — there is no
  fuselage or nacelle `Cy_β`/`Cn_β` — so lateral load factors and yaw
  accelerations are **over-stated and conservative**, not correct. Do not read
  `n_y` or `ψ̈` as a lateral response of the airplane.
- **The 23.427(a) unsymmetrical horizontal tail ships as a handed pair, and it
  is a *maneuver* case.** An asymmetric case exists only as a starboard/port
  twin by centreline reflection; a reader given one hand must know the other
  exists. Its V-n point is the maneuver point, not a gust point.
- **`concept_heavy` is closure-locked, not oracle-locked** (decision **D-R6**),
  as is every concept-mode result above the FAR 23 calibrated band. Concept mode
  is an unverified extrapolation with a stated physics-closure gate behind it —
  it is not a validated analysis, and the report says so wherever the figures
  are read.

The FAR 23 replication core remains oracle-locked to Appendix A within ±0.1 %;
concept mode reduces exactly to it on GA inputs. Verification baseline for this
release: [`docs/40_history/09_verification_baseline_0.5.0.md`](docs/40_history/09_verification_baseline_0.5.0.md).


### Added

- **The report's known-limitations list is every open caveat, and says so
  testably.** 0.5.0 row 2, review finding **F-R4**, decision **D-R3**. The list
  claimed completeness and was missing four: the **fin-only lateral aero** (the
  only lateral aerodynamic load the suite computes, so `n_y` and yaw
  acceleration are over-stated), the **lumped aileron couple** (23.349 applied
  at the wing AC because there is no aileron spanwise geometry), the **wing
  stick model's centreline clamp** (its SPC reaction is the half-span total, not
  a wing root design load) and the **flight-only fuselage deck** (no ground
  case, per D-R3 — stated now as a positive claim, not as two adjacent absences).
  - **The assumed tail planform now reaches the report.** `resolve_tail_planform`
    derives a rectangle from the area/span scalars when `geometry.surfaces`
    carries no entry for the surface and marks it ASSUMED; that marker reached
    the page, the CSV and the result and stopped, so the controlling document
    described the distribution as if the planform had been entered. It is a
    **conditional** limitation, resolved from the project's own inputs so a
    headless bundle states it too, and it names the surface — no shipped fixture
    enters a tail planform, so every current bundle carries both.
  - **One wording per caveat.** Where a caveat also travels in band, the report
    quotes the owning module's constant verbatim rather than paraphrasing it:
    `balance.LATERAL_AERO_NOTE`, the new `balance.AILERON_COUPLE_NOTE` (extracted
    from the ACRL case note, unchanged text, so no deck byte moved) and
    `sbeam_bridge.CENTERLINE_CLAMP_NOTE` (reworded once to serve both the deck
    and the document; `wing_stick` digests regenerated).
  - **The completeness guard:** standing limitations are declared with stable
    keys and the key set is pinned by test, so opening or closing a caveat is a
    visible edit in the same commit rather than a silent omission; separate tests
    assert each one reaches the statement, that the in-band and report wordings
    are one string, and that the conditional planform caveat is absent when a
    planform is entered. `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §4.6 now states the contract.

- **The wing stick deck states its centerline clamp, and every deck `$`
  comment now fits the card width.** 0.5.0 row 1, closing the last of the
  release's Phase-1 deliverable items and the wing/tail decks' own digest
  regeneration. Two parts, landed together because they move the same exported
  wing bytes:
  - **The clamp caveat** (plan 10 §1.1, filed 2026-08-08 and not shippable then
    because that step's acceptance forbade any exported byte change). The wing
    stick model's `SPC1` now carries a `$` note naming the clamped node as the
    aircraft **centerline** (BL 0, half a strip inboard of station 0 — every
    fixture defines the wing LE polyline from the centerline) and its reaction
    as the **half-span total applied load**, not a wing root design load. It
    states why relocating the SPC would not help — one clamp reacts the whole
    applied load wherever it sits, so the side-of-body quantity is an internal
    CBAR load, and the deck has no node at the side of body — so a consumer
    reads the limitation off the deck instead of discovering it against a
    23 %-high root bending. The real fix stays filed as the side-of-body
    reporting-node item.
  - **The 72-column sweep now covers the wing decks.** Free-field bulk data is
    72 columns; the wing `$ Axes:` and `$ FORCE set sums to root Sz … Myy …`
    lines overran, reaching ~100 columns in SI where the same numbers are wider
    (cosmetic — `$` is a comment to every parser — but the carve-out was the
    only deck family the width guard skipped). Every generated `$` sentence in
    the bridge now goes through one `_comment()` emitter that wraps at 70, so
    the width is a property of the emitter rather than of each hand-fitted
    sentence, and `test_deck_comments_fit_the_free_field_card_width` sweeps
    `wing_cards` and `wing_stick` in both unit systems alongside body/tail/
    control. The unit statement moved to its own `$ Lengths in <unit>.` line:
    wrapping can split a clause anywhere, and that is the one line consumers
    grep for.
  - **Imperial digests regenerated deliberately**, and the diff is exactly the
    two intended channels — `sbeam/wing_cards` and `sbeam/wing_stick` on all
    six examples, 12 lines. No calc number moved; the balanced deck, whose
    digest regeneration was spent three times over on D-R7/D-R8, is untouched.

- **The 23.427(a) unsymmetrical horizontal tail is a balanced case.** 0.5.0
  row 1 — decision **D-R8**, review finding **F-R5**, the release's one L-tier
  physics step. `build_balanced_cases` gained a third component branch, and with
  it the assembled deliverable gained the one horizontal-tail condition that has
  a **hand**: FAR 23.427(a) puts 100 % of half the governing tail load on one
  side and `min(100 − 10(n−1), 80)` percent on the other, and until now that
  left/right content had no assembled representation at all — the full-span tail
  topology (plan 09 **T-8**) had been built for it and nothing used it. It ships
  as a handed pair per fixture (`HT-09R`/`HT-09L`, SUBCASE 7209/8209 on
  `ga6_normal` and `concept_regional_jet`), which is precisely 23.427(a)'s
  "either side".

  - **SELECT's split is distributed, never recomputed**, through the full-span
    `tail_span` table (`balance.htail_sets`, `source="htail-air"`) — air only,
    the surface mass riding the closure field with everything else, so each mass
    still enters exactly one field. It **replaces** the lumped trim tail load
    `vn.lt`: `RH + LH` *is* the condition's whole tail load, and carrying both
    would count the balancing part twice.
  - **The pre-closure residual is the maneuver, and is reported rather than
    gated.** 23.427(a)'s load is a *maneuver* load and its V-n point is a
    balanced one at `n_z ≈ 1` — an abrupt elevator input with the wing still at
    trim lift — so the airplane is genuinely out of trim: −49.8 % of `n·W` and
    144 % of `n·W·MAC` on `ga6_normal`, closing as Δn −0.496 g and
    q̇ +637 deg/s². That is the standard treatment of an unbalanced pitching
    maneuver, and it is the case that sizes the aft fuselage. What **is** gated,
    at the usual 1 %, is the case's *trim half* — the same case with the lumped
    load restored (0.301 % on the ga6). Said in-band on the deck header, the
    case notes, report §6 and the Balanced Cases page, never left to be worked
    out from a number that looks like a failure.
  - **Two closed forms check what is applied**, standing in for the printed
    oracle concept mode does not have: each half sums to SELECT's own `RH`/`LH`
    exactly (6.7e-16), and the applied rolling moment is `(RH − LH)·ȳ` with `ȳ`
    the chord-weighted half-planform centroid — ratio 1.000000000 on both
    fixtures.
  - **Handedness now reads the distribution's own roll.** This case carries no
    side force and no free `mx`, so `is_handed` would have minted it *unhanded*
    and emitted one twin; it gains a net-rolling-moment test against
    `HANDEDNESS_TOL · n·W · b/2`, where the two populations are fifteen orders
    apart (a mirror-symmetric set nets 1e-17 of that scale, this case 1.7e-2).
  - **Fixed, found by building it: the closure was referred to the entered CG.**
    The rigid-body relief field is now solved about the **mass set's own
    centroid**. The two coincide on every loading the fixtures had before — which
    is why a decoupled `n = F/W` solve never showed it — but `ga6_normal`'s
    `CG4` sits 0.0024 in forward and 0.0052 in below its entered CG, and an
    angular acceleration about the wrong point leaves `−ω̇ × Σ wᵢrᵢ` of unclosed
    force: nothing at a trimmed case's ω̇, **0.31 lb of `Fx`** at 637 deg/s²,
    four orders above the closure gate. The reported residual is still stated
    about the CG; only the relief is solved where it is exact.
  - **The assembly record stops calling the h-tail out-of-family.** Its
    symmetric conditions are not excluded — they are *already in* every balanced
    case as the trim tail load — so they are recorded under a new
    `htail-symmetric` reason that says so, leaving `out-of-family` for the
    fuselage, ground and one-engine-out conditions it actually describes.

  Design note: [`docs/30_future/16_d_r8_unsymmetrical_htail_note.md`](docs/30_future/16_d_r8_unsymmetrical_htail_note.md);
  method and worked numbers in `docs/20_theory/balanced_cases.md` §8. Gates:
  eight in `tests/test_balance.py` plus the solver leg. **Bytes moved:** the
  four new subcases regenerate `csv/balance`, `txt/balance` and
  `sbeam/balanced_deck` on the two fixtures that assemble — and nothing else,
  the closure's new reference point being a no-op everywhere the two points
  coincide.

- **`concept_heavy` joins the sbeam round-trip gate.** 0.5.0 row 1 — the
  remainder of decision **D-R6**, whose diagnosis (review **F-C6**) had already
  restored the fixture's export. Its wing deck now solves in the real solver, in
  both unit systems, on the `WING_MATRIX` leg of
  `tests/test_sbeam_roundtrip.py`. It is the only fixture in that matrix whose
  wing cases name **only** a V-n case reference — no `cl`, no `v_eas_kt`, no
  `nz` — so until now the *derived* CL/V route, the one F-C6 found broken, had
  no solver coverage at all: the deck it produces was never handed to sbeam in
  CI. It also carries a second, differently-shaped concentrated wing item (a
  600 lb store per side, offset in `z` as well as `x`), so the offset-couple
  `MOMENT` cards are now exercised on two independent geometries rather than
  `atr42_100` alone. Wing leg only — the fixture assembles no balanced case, so
  it has no body, tail or assembled deck to gate. No shipped bytes move.

- **The assembled deck and the mass model are first-class deliverables.** 0.5.0
  row 1 — decision **D-R2**, review finding **F-D2**. The mission's *primary*
  loads output was a page-only download: `balanced_airframe.bdf` left the tool
  from the Balanced Cases page carrying no methods stamp, named by no report
  section, no manifest row and no Export bundle, and the three CONM2/MASSSET
  files left it the same way from the Weights page. An artifact the controlling
  document does not name travels without a basis — which is exactly the state
  the G8.3 stamp and the manifest exist to prevent. All of it closes together:

  - **Report §6, "Balanced free-free airframe cases."** Per case: load factor
    `Nz`, the **pre-closure** residuals against the 1 % gate, the applied roll
    couple and the closure relief (`Δn`, `Δn_y`, yaw and roll acceleration) —
    literally `balanced_case_rows`' own rows, the ones the deck header and the
    Balanced Cases page render, so the report cannot describe a different
    assembly from the deck beside it. Plus the handed twin-pair statement (an
    asymmetric case ships as a starboard/port pair; a reader shown one hand must
    be told of the other) and the **mass-case identity** table: which payload
    case is which `MASSSET`, at what weight and CG, with every case the weight
    database cannot produce marked NOT EXPORTED and its reason. A project that
    assembles nothing keeps the section and says so.
  - **Manifest rows** for `balanced_airframe.bdf`, `mass_model.bdf`,
    `mass_check.bdf` and `inertia_only.bdf` — each with its units, its
    convention and the section that summarises it — listed only when the bundle
    will actually contain them, because a manifest naming a file that was never
    written sends the reader looking for it.
  - **The Export bundle** carries all four, stamped with the same `_bdf_stamp`
    and written in the same resolved unit system as every other deck, so "one
    bundle, one system, one basis" still holds by construction; they also get
    their own download row on the page.
  - **The two page-level downloads are stamped** (the routes F-D2 named): the
    Balanced Cases deck and all three Weights-page mass files. A CONM2 set whose
    `M` is read as weight is wrong by 386× in a file that parses cleanly, so the
    unit statement travelling in-band is not a formality.
  - **One mint for the mass-case identity** (CLAUDE.md practice 3):
    `mass_cards.massset_identity(loading, index)` is now the sole source of a
    case's `MASSSET` SID and label, read by the cards, the report and the
    manifest; `mass_case_rows` is its row form. The balanced assembly likewise
    runs **once** per report (`content.balanced_run`), shared by §4's
    skipped-conditions record and §6, so the two halves of that statement cannot
    describe different runs.

  No exported byte moves: the deck writers were already stamp-capable and the
  digests are unchanged. Guards: the Export page's stamp-and-system source
  guards extended from 5 decks to 9 and from 11 writer calls to 14 plus the
  balanced deck, and seven new report-content tests pin the section, the twin
  pairs, the identity mint, the NOT EXPORTED path, the absence statement and
  both directions of the manifest rule.

- **The deliverable is scriptable: every export target, stamped, with one error
  contract.** 0.5.0 row 1 — review findings **F-D1**, **F-C2**, **F-D3**, minor
  **m2**, decision **D-R5**, absorbing the long-open **L-8g**. The mission is a
  *scripted* concept-loads → sbeam sizing loop, and the headless route did not
  reach the deliverable: `--export-target` offered wing, tail, the two spanwise
  empennage surfaces and control surfaces, so the **fuselage** deck (FORCE cards,
  span CSV and the wing-attach fitting loads) was unwritable from the CLI and the
  **assembled full-span balanced deck** — the mission's *primary* artifact — had
  no headless route at all, downloadable only from a Streamlit page. It does now,
  as does the CONM2 mass model (`--export-target mass`, the same owner and file
  names as `--export-conm2`). `cli.EXPORT_TARGETS` is the one list, handed to
  argparse and pinned against the CLI docstring, so a target cannot be
  implemented without being offered or offered without being implemented.

  Two things travel with it. **The CLI wing deck is now stated about the loads
  reference axis** (decision D-R5): the CLI passed the writers a bare result
  list, so the LRA boundary transfer never ran and a headless deck's torsion,
  station X and lever arms were about the 25 % chord while the GUI's were about
  the LRA — labelled in-band, so not silently wrong, but the module contract was
  defeated on exactly the route the sizing loop scripts. The two front-ends now
  emit the same deck, pinned by test on a project whose LRA is *not* the quarter
  chord; on every shipped fixture `ref_axis_pct` is 0.25, so **no exported byte
  moves and no digest regeneration was needed**. And **every headless CSV and BDF
  now carries the Step G8.3 methods & limitations stamp** (L-8g / F-D3),
  including `-o` module CSVs and all three `--export-conm2` artifacts: a headless
  export stated its ULTIMATE basis, its category and its approved corrections
  nowhere, which made it the one channel in the suite whose files were not
  self-describing when forwarded. One stamp per run, built from the resolved unit
  system and handed to every writer; no timestamp unless `--generated` supplies
  one, so two runs of one project stay byte-identical and diffable.

- **One CLI error contract.** Review **m2**: the `control` target caught every
  `ValueError`, so a mistyped aileron area was indistinguishable from an airplane
  with no aileron — the deck simply came out a case short — while an all-skipped
  run raised through `main` as a traceback, the wing and tail targets let
  `MissingInputError` reach the terminal raw, and only `--export-conm2` caught
  and printed. Now, on every route: `error: <message>` on stderr, exit status 1,
  no traceback and no partial artifact set. The one deliberate exception is that
  an **absent** control-surface slice still skips that surface (the three are
  independent inputs) while an **invalid** one fails the run — the
  `MissingInputError`-vs-`ValueError` distinction the error-handling contract
  already draws, applied at the CLI boundary.

- **The balanced assembly now states what it did *not* assemble.** Review
  finding **F-C7**: a condition whose V-n point was missing, whose CG case was
  unknown, or whose payload loading the weight database cannot derive was
  dropped by `build_balanced_cases` with no record on the `ModuleResult`, in the
  deck, or in the report — and the only thing standing between that and a user's
  project was a test that pins the *shipped fixtures'* drop set. On
  `concept_regional_jet` the primary deliverable has been quietly missing NMAA;
  it now says so, in the deck's own `$ CONDITIONS NOT ASSEMBLED` block, in report
  §4, on the Balanced Cases page, and as a final "Assembly record" condition on
  the module result. Each entry names the condition, its V-n point and a reason
  from one of five codes, with the deliberate exclusions (h-tail, fuselage,
  ground, one-engine-out) recorded as such rather than left to be inferred from
  their absence. The record is emitted whether or not anything was skipped:
  "every condition assembled" is the completeness statement. The gate is the
  property rather than the fixture — assembled ∪ recorded is exactly SELECT's
  condition set, and the two are disjoint, on every example — so a sixth
  `continue` cannot be added without a reason travelling with it. Imperial
  baseline regenerated for the three affected channels (balance CSV, balance
  text report, assembled deck) on the two fixtures that assemble.

- **One owner for every exported id band: `sloads/export/bands.py`.** Review
  findings **F-C1** (the defect) and **F-G3** (its root cause). GID/EID/SID runs
  were per-file constants with docstrings claiming disjointness, checked by two
  tests that hand-enumerated the families their authors remembered — so when the
  balanced deck opened `4001+` for its right wing, which the spanwise h-tail deck
  already owned as `4001–4500`, nothing saw it for two months. A splice of those
  two decks would have summed a wing load and a tail load on one node in a file
  that parses cleanly. The registry declares every band (name, kind, start, size,
  owner, and why it sits where it does) with the whole map in its module
  docstring; every allocator now goes through `Band.allocate`, which raises on
  overflow instead of walking into the next family — closing review **m5**, the
  wing station allocator that had no capacity guard at all, and giving the
  control-surface band its first one (`control_station_gid`).
  `tests/test_bands.py` asks the disjointness question of the **whole registry**
  pairwise, and — the part that makes it blind-spot-free — sweeps the module
  globals of every module under `sloads/export`, failing any id-base constant
  that is not a registered band's start. A future deck family cannot re-open the
  hole by forgetting a test. `case_ids.SUBCASE_BLOCK` stays the allocator for the
  per-component subcase SIDs (calc must not import export); the registry mirrors
  them and a test pins the mirror so neither can move alone.

- **The assembled deck's card-text closure gate now checks all six DOF.** Review
  finding **F-G1**: `test_the_deck_balances_from_its_own_cards` asserted `fx`,
  `fz` and `my` while `equilibrium.Resultant` had carried the lateral three all
  along — so the node-collapse failure mode the gate exists for (in memory 1e-13,
  in the deck 3.9–21.9 % out) could hit a fin `FORCE` card or a reflected
  port-twin node and unbalance `fy`/`mx`/`mz` with nothing looking. Not
  theoretical since B8a-3: every assembled deck carries eight lateral cases, and
  the handed twins differ *only* in those components. Roll and yaw are judged
  against the **semi-span**, the same lever `roll_residual_fraction` uses, so the
  deck gate and the closure report agree on what "small" means.
  `test_the_lateral_half_of_the_deck_gate_has_teeth` measures the gain: one
  reversed lateral `FORCE` card leaves `fy` 3.4 %, `mz` 3.1 % and `mx` 0.20 % out
  while `fx`/`fz`/`my` stay at 1e-9…1e-8 — the old gate would have called that
  deck balanced. Swept to the sibling free-free gate in the same change (required
  practice 4): the body deck's `Σ = 0` claim now covers its other four
  components, which are zero by construction on a planar flight-only deck and
  will go red — deliberately — when the ground cases bring side and drag loads.

- **The CONM2 mass model is now solved in CI — the fourth deck family, in both
  unit systems.** Plan 12's **C6** leg, open since 2026-08-08 and the reason the
  `GRAV` defect below could ship: the mass-check deck is handed to the real
  sbeam, which accelerates the `CONM2` set through its own mass matrix and must
  reproduce sloads' per-case inertia **at every node**, Imperial and SI
  (`tests/test_sbeam_roundtrip.py`, `ga6_normal` / `concept_regional_jet` /
  `atr42_100`, at Nz = 2.5). Three statements with independent producers: the
  clamp reacts the case's own weight, the recovered nodal loads equal
  `inertia_only_cards(loading=...)` card for card, and the cases differ from each
  other *in their distribution* (the regional jet's two cases weigh the same and
  differ only in CG, so a total-only check would pass vacuously). The leg's teeth
  are a reproduction of the C1 defect itself: a 25.4×-low `GRAV` must fail it.
- **`inertia_only_cards` can state a payload case.** Given a `loading` it writes
  that case's mass node by node — wing items included, on the node their `CONM2`
  hangs on — which is the only form that can equal sbeam's recovery rather than
  merely resemble it (the gross Ch 15 beam table is case-independent and carries
  no wing). Default output is byte-identical; the CLI and the Weights page are
  unchanged. New `mass_cards.case_station_weights` owns the gathering, built on
  the same `_attach_gid` the cards are written with.
- **Known sbeam limitation, pinned rather than worked around silently.** sbeam's
  SOL 101 assembles its `GRAV` load vector from the **baseline** mass matrix and
  never reaches the `MASSSET` resolver, so at the pinned commit every payload
  subcase of the shipped mass-check deck accelerates the same mass (`ga6_normal`:
  2063 lb four times, against case weights 3400/3400/2800/2063). The round-trip
  leg therefore folds each case into a baseline deck first
  (`export/roundtrip.flatten_mass_case`, test-only, and it may re-select cards
  but never rewrite one). `test_the_shipped_mass_deck_hits_the_sbeam_massset_gap`
  records the behaviour and is *meant* to go red when sbeam fixes it.

- **The summary report states its sign conventions, with pictures.** A new
  required section **"2. Axes and sign conventions"** (SUMMARY_REPORT.md
  §4.2.1, design note 15): the frame and reflection prose, a
  conventions-of-record table citing the charter per row, and three static
  inline-TikZ figures (`sign_axes` / `sign_controls` / `sign_beams`) drawing
  +α/+β, the moment senses, the control and rotation signs, and the
  per-component shear/moment/torsion diagram conventions. Single-sourced in
  `sloads/report/conventions_tex.py`, drift-guarded by
  `tests/test_report_conventions.py` (frame vs `export/coordinates.py`, the
  §3.3 sentences verbatim, greyscale/ASCII/determinism). Downstream sections
  renumbered (Envelope figures → 3 … Methods → 6). With it, the six formerly
  unstated conventions are decisions of record **SC-1…SC-6**
  (`CONVENTIONS.md` §1.1, user-approved 2026-08-10): +β = wind from starboard,
  +rudder = TE to port, rates right-handed/attitudes not modelled, twist
  nose-up-positive (verified in the Schrenk basic-lift formula), gear V/D/S in
  airplane axes, aileron hand named per case. Labels only — no computed number
  changed anywhere.


- **The vertical tail carries inertia on both of its axes** (user decision
  2026-08-10, **superseding plan 13 decision L-8 for the per-condition view**).
  A fin's normal axis is lateral, so the vertical acceleration that *bends* a
  horizontal tail *compresses* a vertical one, and the fin needs two terms where
  the h-tail needs one:
  - **bending**, `−n_y·W_vt`, with `n_y = (LT25+LT50)/W_case` — the free-free
    lateral response to the fin's own load, the only lateral aerodynamic force
    this suite models. It relieves the surface total by **exactly** `W_vt/W_case`
    (0.68 % on `ga6_normal`, 1.84 % on the RJ), which is what makes it
    self-checking, and it inherits decision **L-7**'s caveat: with no fuselage or
    wing sideslip force modelled, the real airplane's `n_y` is smaller and that
    relief is an upper bound on itself. Stated in-band on every fin result, deck
    header and UI row — including that it is the unconservative direction.
  - **axial**, `−n_z·W_vt`, along the span: it compresses the fin and bends
    nothing. New `WingStationLoad.f_span`/`.s_span` columns, mapped to airplane
    axes by the new `coordinates.tail_axial_to_airplane`, and carried in the same
    `FORCE` cards as the normal load.

  A fin condition naming no V-n point has no case weight, so it gets **no**
  lateral term and says so, rather than dividing by a gross-weight stand-in.

- **`component` is editable on the Weights page.** The weight data base's item
  editor exposed `kind` but never `component`, so the tag that decides which beam
  carries each item — and which is now the *only* way to enter tail mass — could
  not be set in the GUI at all. It is a select column with a blank (untagged,
  inferred) option, and the Tail Span Loads page's own mass form is **gone**:
  that page now shows the derived weight read-only, names any untagged surface,
  reports any override, and links back to the page that owns the data.

- **Tail gates**: the fin's `Σ inertia / Σ air ≡ −W_vt/W_case` identity; the axial
  column against `−n_z·W_vt` with a proof it makes no bending; the derived weight
  against each fixture's tagged items; a regression gate that **no shipped
  fixture produces an air-only h-tail deck**; the override/reconciliation path;
  the v44 migration hop; and a balance gate that the applied fin set is air only.

- **`coordinates.bending_moment_vector`** — the single owner of the wing bending
  sign map. `Mxx` maps to `+x` but `Mzz` maps to `−z` (the calc stores both as
  positive-magnitude integrals, against a right-handed `r × F`); that asymmetry
  now lives in one function instead of being spelled out at the card writer and
  copied again at its gate.
- **Wing deck gates**: bending closure now covers **both** channels on **all six**
  fixtures with no exception (the old test asserted the *negation* on the three
  affected ones); a new station-by-station gate asserts shear and bending at
  *every* node, which is what separates the offset couple from the force split
  originally proposed; and a guard pins that the couples exist at exactly the
  nodes bracketing a concentrated mass and nowhere else.
- **`atr42_100` joins the sbeam round-trip wing leg** (`WING_MATRIX`). The solver
  matrix was `ga6_normal` + `concept_regional_jet`, both mass-free, so nothing
  proved the real solver *honours* an `Mx` component rather than dropping it.
  Assertion W-d — element 1's end-B bending against the NETLOADS root `Mxx` —
  read 1.91 % high there until the couples existed.
- **Span-load CSV** gains `Mx`/`Mz` columns, keeping its stated contract that the
  applied-load columns *are* the exported `FORCE`/`MOMENT` cards.


- **Lateral balanced airplane cases — the ±β empennage set** (mission phase 4
  step 8, [plan 13](docs/30_future/13_b8a_lateral_closure_plan.md) step
  **B8a-3**, decisions **L-6**/**L-7**/**L-8**). The four vertical-tail
  conditions (`SUDDEN RUDDER`, `YAW TO SIDESLIP`, `YAW 15 NEUTRAL`, `SIDE GUST`)
  now assemble as full-span free-free cases, each as a **handed pair** —
  `VT-01R`/`VT-01L` … `VT-04R`/`VT-04L`, the starboard case computed and the port
  one its mirror. Eight new cases per fixture on `ga6_normal` and
  `concept_regional_jet` (15 and 14 balanced cases in total).

  The fin's distributed side load is SELECT's, strip for strip, reaching the case
  through `tail_span` and the existing frame map in `export/coordinates.py` (span
  → `z`, normal force → `fy`, torsion → `mz` **negated**). Fin **inertia** rides
  in the closure field at the case's own `n_y`/`ω̇` rather than in the
  per-component v-tail deck, which stays air-only (decision **L-8**).

  **Nothing balances a rudder kick**, and the deck says so: a lateral case's
  pre-closure `Fy`/`Mz` *are* the fin load in full, by construction, so plan 11's
  1 % residual gate does not apply to them — exactly the standing `ACRL`'s roll
  residual has had since B7. What is gated is that the case's **symmetric half**,
  with the fin set removed, still closes as it always did; it does, to the last
  digit, because the fin set carries `fy` and `mz` only.

  Reported per case, in the deck header, the balanced-case table and the module
  result: the applied fin side load, the lateral load factor `n_y = L_v/W`, and
  the yaw and roll accelerations it drives — for example `ga6_normal`
  `SUDDEN RUDDER` +585.7 lb, `n_y` +0.172 g, `ψ̈` +178.0 deg/s², `ṗ` −12.0
  deg/s²; the RJ's `YAW 15 NEUTRAL` −8042.7 lb, −0.244 g, −55.7, +68.4. All four
  numbers are pinned per fixture in CI in both directions.

  **A stated limitation, carried in-band** (decision **L-7**): the fin is the
  only lateral aerodynamic load this suite computes — fuselage and wing side
  force in sideslip are not modelled — so `n_y` and the yaw acceleration are
  **over-stated by an unknown amount**, and the inertia they drive is
  conservative on every component. The fin's own design load is SELECT's,
  unchanged. The caveat travels as a case note into the deck `$` header and the
  report rather than living only in documentation.

  **The assembled deck carrying these cases solves in the real sbeam** with its
  determinate support reacting zero in all six components (plan 13 **G3**, step
  **B8a-4**) — the first time the round-trip gate exercises `fy`, `mx` and `mz`.
  Two additions make that statement worth its zero target: every assembled case
  must appear as a subcase and each lateral one must carry real side load into
  the solver, and a **negative control** reverses the fin load alone and asserts
  the support then reacts `+2·L_v·SF` in `y`, with the roll and yaw reactions
  moving with it. Both unit systems, both fixtures, in CI.
- **Theory document for the balancing method** —
  [`docs/20_theory/balanced_cases.md`](docs/20_theory/balanced_cases.md): how a
  balanced free-free case is assembled and closed, with worked examples on the
  shipped fixtures (ga6 PHAA symmetric, ga6/RJ ACRL antisymmetric) and the
  design-of-record lateral empennage cases on a conventional low tail (ga6) and
  a T-tail (RJ), every shipped figure mapped to the CI gate that pins it.
- **`VTailLoadsInput.vtail_root_waterline_z`** (schema **v43**) — the fin root
  waterline, stated rather than derived. `0` means "derive it and mark it
  `assumed`", which every shipped fixture still does; the derived value and the
  branch that produced it are carried in-band on the result, the page and the
  deck `$` header. Additive with a default, so no migration hop: a pre-v43
  project keeps exactly the placement it would have been given.


### Fixed

- **`scripts/smoke_test.sh` — the §3.5 release gate — read the G8.3 methods
  stamp as the CSV header row and failed the release it was gating.** It took
  line 1 of the CLI's output as the header, but since G8.3 every exported CSV
  carries the methods & limitations statement as `#` lines above it, so the
  script saw `# METHODS AND LIMITATIONS` and reported an unexpected header. The
  in-repo *Python* readers were audited when the stamp landed
  (`workbook._csv_to_df` reads with `comment="#"`); this shell one was not. It
  now skips comment lines like every other reader, counts rows from the data
  block, and additionally **requires** the stamp to be present — so the gate
  proves the CLI's deliverable states its own basis rather than merely tolerating
  the lines that say so.

- **The `.xlsx` workbook stated one unit system for two channels** (review
  **m14**; SUMMARY_REPORT.md §3.5/§4.7). One workbook carries both: the module
  and case-index sheets are the HUMAN channel, the span-load sheets are the
  SOLVER channel that feeds the sbeam decks — and in SI those sets differ
  (`N·m`/`kPa` against `N·mm`/`MPa`). The Project sheet's single `Units` row
  therefore mis-stated every span sheet in the workbook by a factor of 1000 in
  moment, which is exactly the failure the in-band statement exists to prevent
  ("a per-file units column that disagrees with that statement is a conformance
  failure, not a footnote"). `build_workbook` now owns the statement instead of
  taking it from the caller: it resolves both channels once from the deliverable
  `system` it is given, writes each data sheet's own set into cell `A1` above
  that sheet's header row, and names both channels plus the unconverted
  KEAS/ft exception on the Project sheet. The case index, which carries no load
  quantity at all, states that rather than claiming either set. Two new tests
  build the workbook in **SI** — where the channels are distinguishable — and
  require each sheet to carry its own set and neither to carry the other's, plus
  a guard that the header row still parses one row down.

- **The "not a certification document" disclaimer travelled on the report's
  title page only** (review **F-R3**; SUMMARY_REPORT.md §4.6 item 9) — the one
  page that does *not* travel with a forwarded file. It was absent from
  `methods_statement`, which is what lands in `METHODS.txt`, every CSV `#`
  header, every BDF `$` header and the workbook's *Methods* sheet, so a deck or
  a span CSV read on its own carried ULTIMATE loads with no statement of what
  they are not. The disclaimer is now a `STATUS:` block **leading** the
  statement — ahead of `BASIS:`, so a reader who skims only the head of a
  stamped file still meets it — and `latex.py`'s title page quotes the same
  `STANDING_DISCLAIMER` constant instead of restating the sentence, adding only
  its pointer to the methods section (two wordings of one disclaimer is two
  disclaimers). The stamp guard, which previously enumerated only the
  implemented blocks and so pinned the omission, now requires `STATUS:`, checks
  the sentence survives both comment wrappers, and pins the single wording
  across the cover and the statement.

- **The governing-loads tables applied a flat 1.5 instead of each case's own
  safety factor** (review **F-R1**; the report-side slice of M4-8 Layer 1).
  `report.governing_loads_table` scaled and labelled every row with
  `ULTIMATE_FACTOR`, ignoring `CriticalCondition.safety_factor` — the model's
  stated contract and what the export side already reads
  (`sbeam_bridge._sf`). No shipped number changes (SELECT stamps the 23.303
  default on every condition today), but the first non-1.5 critical case would
  have been silently mis-scaled and mis-labelled in report §5 and in **both**
  GUI views (Results Review headline, Flight Envelope "Critical Loads"), which
  read the same helper — a report figure and its bulk-data card could have
  stated different factors for one case. Each row now scales by its own case's
  factor and its `SF` cell states that factor; the caller-supplied `sf`
  override is **removed**, so the case stays the single owner of its factor and
  there is no path back to a flat one. The test that pinned the hole (every row
  `SF == 1.5`) now asserts the contract, and a new test sets one condition to
  `SF = 1.0` and checks that row is neither re-scaled nor mislabelled while its
  neighbours are untouched.

- **The fuselage deliverables rendered a platform-dependent negative zero, and
  CI failed on a difference that was not a difference.** Found from a CI report
  of `sbeam/body_cards` drift against the Imperial digest baseline while the
  same commit passed locally. The body deck's stated `Applied Fz set sums to …`
  and `Terminal Myy …`, and the span CSV's terminal cumulative `Sz`/`Myy`, are
  the free-free equilibrium — exactly zero in exact arithmetic, ~1e-11 of
  cancellation dust in floating point. The magnitude is far below any printed
  precision, but the **sign** of that dust is not reproducible across platforms
  (x86 and ARM reassociate the upstream arithmetic differently), so the same
  code printed `0.00` on one machine and `-0.00` on another. New
  `sbeam_bridge._closed()` snaps a zero-by-construction quantity to an unsigned
  zero relative to its own column's scale — the rule the `FORCE` cards already
  had (nothing under `_TOL` is emitted) extended to the totals that describe
  them. Guarded by
  `test_the_body_deliverables_never_render_a_negative_zero`, both unit systems
  (SI is the worse case: the same dust is 175× larger in newtons). `body_cards`
  and `body_span` digests regenerated.

  *Not swept in the same change:* structural negative zeros elsewhere (~2,000
  `-0.000000E+00` components in the balanced deck, the tail span CSV's `Fax`
  column) come from `-1 × 0.0`, are bit-identical on every platform, and are
  cosmetic only. Normalising them would move every deck family's digests, so it
  is filed rather than folded in here.

- **The bundle manifest pointed three companion files at the wrong report
  section, and now the numbering has an owner.** 0.5.0 row 1, review finding
  **F-R2**. The manifest's "Summarised in" column sent the case index to §3
  (envelope figures), the load-case CSVs and the text report to §4 (conditions
  analysed) and METHODS.txt to §5 (results) — one short after the §2
  sign-conventions insertion, and two short for methods after the §6 balanced
  section moved it to §7. They now read §4, §5 and §7. The tail rows pointed at
  a "§4 Tails" subsection that does not exist; they name the real
  `Horizontal tail / Vertical tail` headings.
  - **Structural, not a re-typing** (`CLAUDE.md` practice 3): `content.SECTIONS`
    is the single ordered source of the numbering, headings come from
    `section_heading(key)` and every cross-reference — the manifest column and
    the rendered prose in the references table, the gear note and the balanced
    section — from `section_ref(key[, subsection])`. Inserting a section now
    renumbers its references with it; a literal `§N` in rendered text is a
    defect.
  - **Pinned four ways**, since the review's actual finding was "no test pins
    the § values": the owner's numbers must equal the document's own section
    positions; each companion file's target section is pinned by key in
    `SUMMARISED_IN` (exhaustive on the GA fixture, so a new manifest row cannot
    slip in unpinned); every manifest reference must resolve to a real section
    and each suffix to a real subsection; and a document-wide sweep of every
    rendered string rejects a reference past the last section.


- **The chordwise fin deck applies a side load, not a vertical one.** Review
  finding **F-C3**, decision of record **D-R4**. `tail_force_moment_cards` wrote
  every component's strip force through `to_force(0, 0, fz)` — the vertical tail
  included — which is the exact hand-rolled pattern `export/coordinates.py`
  names as the canonical trap: the fin's normal force is a **side** force, so a
  consumer splicing those cards into an airplane-axes model loaded the fin in the
  one direction it is not designed for. The deck now takes its axis from
  `coordinates.tail_force_to_airplane`, the single owner the spanwise tail family
  already used, so the two tail deck families no longer disagree about the fin.
  Byte-changing, and stated in-band rather than only in the code:

  - Each case block carries `$ Load is normal to the surface = Fy|Fz in airplane
    axes` and names that axis in its applied-sum line; the shared `GRID` block
    says the same for both components. The label is read out of the map
    (`_tail_force_axis`) rather than tabled a second time, so a header and its
    cards cannot drift apart.
  - `tail_chordwise.csv`'s `Fz` column becomes `Fn` (the normal force) with an
    `Axis` column beside it — the CSV was mislabelling the fin's rows the same
    way, and the two chordwise deliverables now state one axis between them; the
    report's companion-file manifest states the same convention for both rows.
  - `test_tail_deck_resultants` and the tail round-trip leg are re-pinned to all
    six resultant components, the zeros included: summing `v[2]` for both
    components is what enshrined the defect, and the fin's chordwise first moment
    is `Mz`, not `My`. The Imperial baseline is regenerated — only
    `sbeam/tail_cards` and `sbeam/tail_chordwise` moved.

- **WING-tagged item mass can no longer vanish from the balanced model, and an
  empty panel weight no longer builds a sign-flipped wing.** Review finding
  **F-C5**. The two halves of the same degeneracy:

  - `balance._wing_inertia_scale` returned `0.0` whenever WINGINER integrated no
    panel, zeroing every wing-inertia load — while `assembly_distributes_mass`
    went on excluding those same WING items from `body_inertia`, because the wing
    set is what is supposed to carry them. The whole WING item weight left the
    model and the six-DOF closure absorbed it silently, under a case note that
    blamed the panel. It now **raises**, naming the orphaned item weight and both
    ways out (enter a panel weight, or retag the items onto the fuselage beam);
    only a loading with no WING item mass scales to zero, and its note says that
    instead of misattributing the cause. No shipped fixture reaches it, which is
    why `test_wing_items_with_no_panel_model_raise_rather_than_vanish` builds the
    case explicitly, with the no-WING-items half beside it.
  - Found while gating it: `panel_weight_lb = 0` never produced the zero panel
    the finding assumed. The BASIC density iteration's ±1 % acceptance band is
    empty at a zero target, so it walked the area density down *through* zero and
    returned **negative** strip masses — −0.108 lb integrated on `ga6_normal`,
    which the scale then turned into a ×−3045 sign-flipped inertia set that still
    summed to the right weight and so passed every existing mass gate.
    `wing_inertia._root_density` short-circuits a non-positive target to an empty
    panel (`test_an_empty_panel_weight_gives_an_empty_panel`), which is also what
    lets the partition gate above fire on the input that actually reaches it.

- **A degenerate chordwise profile raises instead of silently emitting an empty
  load set.** Review finding **F-C4**. Both chordwise writers scale their
  trapezoidal tributary set so it sums to the condition's own critical load;
  when the profile integrated to zero the scale fell back to `0.0`, so the tail
  or control-surface deck carried **no load at all** while its case header still
  claimed the non-zero applied sum — a deck contradicting itself, against the
  raise-loudly contract every neighbouring path in `sbeam_bridge` honors. The
  shared owner `_trapezoid_tributary_forces` now raises, naming the component
  or surface, its case, the profile integral and the load it cannot carry. A
  zero case load is not contradictory and keeps its zero set.
  `test_degenerate_chordwise_profile_raises` pins both writers, on the all-zero
  profile and on the antisymmetric one that cancels to the same degeneracy.

- **The `project.envelope` bypass class is closed, and it now has a drift guard.**
  Review finding **F-C6**, the sweep the `tail_span` `n = 1.0` defect (below) was
  the first-found instance of. One fact drives all of them:
  `registry.run_all_modules` — the path the Export page, the CLI and every
  deliverable take — **never assigns `Project.envelope`**, so a module that reads
  it directly does not get "the persisted envelope when there is one"; headless it
  gets `None`, and every one of the four surviving sites then did something wrong
  *quietly*:

  - `wing_inertia._critical_wing_conditions` returned `[]`, so a project that left
    `wing_mass.cases` empty derived **no wing cases at all** and both WINGINER and
    NETLOADS raised "needs at least one load case" — the SELECT-derived case route
    (M4-2 decision 2) was dead headless, exactly like `tail_span`'s V-n read.
  - `wing_inertia.wing_case_ref` read the V-n point the same way, so every wing
    case in the case index shipped with **no CG and no altitude** — the deck named
    a load without the flight condition it was flown at.
  - `net_loads._air_cl_v` raised `MissingInputError` on a derived case it could
    have resolved.
  - `body_loads` did the inverse: `_critical_fuselage` preferred the *persisted*
    conditions while the distribution loop integrated them against a **freshly
    rebuilt** V-n matrix — one case, `nz`/`lt` from a different envelope than the
    one that selected it.
  - `balance` duplicated the owner's rule as `project.envelope or
    build_envelope(project)`, which accepts a persisted envelope carrying an
    **empty `vn`**: every condition then failed its V-n lookup and dropped out
    under a misleading "nothing to balance".

  `select` now owns the whole rule: `default_envelope` (unchanged),
  `default_critical` for the critical set, and `vn_points`/`vn_by_case` as the
  tolerant read for consumers with a documented in-band fallback. `tail_span` and
  `taildist` delegate to them instead of carrying their own copies, and the two
  wing modules share one `wing_case_sources(project)` resolved per build and
  threaded into every helper (the `envelope=` threading convention of M2R-8), so
  `wing_inertia` and `net_loads` cannot resolve different points for the same case
  list and the envelope is not rebuilt once per case.

  The guard is `tests/test_envelope_owner.py`: an **AST scan** of `sloads/` fails
  any new direct `project.envelope` read, with a five-entry allowlist whose
  entries each state why they are not the persisted-else-compute rule (and a second test that
  drops a stale allowlist entry). Six of its gates fail against the pre-fix code,
  including the `tail_span` instance, which had no pin until now.

  **Imperial output moves in one place, by metadata only:** `atr42_100`'s wing
  case index and stick-deck `$ SUBCASE` line now state `CGfwd / 185.9 kt / 0 ft /
  FAR 23.333(b)` where they stated a blank CG, `170 kt`, no altitude and
  `23.301(b)`. That is M4-2 decision 1 (a condition SELECT already named keeps
  SELECT's `CaseRef`) finally applying headless as it always did with a persisted
  envelope. **No load number changes, on any fixture, in any channel** — the
  digests for the other five examples are byte-identical. The fixture enters
  `PHAA` by hand at CL 1.55 / 170 kt while SELECT's `PHAA` point is 1.7283 /
  185.85 kt (`balance.py`'s module docstring records the divergence), so the row
  now states a flight condition the entered numbers were not computed at; filed as
  its own backlog row rather than settled inside this sweep.

- **The SI mass-check deck's gravity was 25.4× low — `GRAV` now carries g in the
  deck's own length unit.** `mass_cards.mass_check_deck` wrote
  `force/(mass × length)`, which is the mass channel's *dimensional identity* and
  therefore 386.0886 in **both** unit systems by construction — g in in/s²,
  always. The SI deck needs 9806.65 mm/s² and instead shipped 386.0886 under a
  header stating "mm/s²": the artifact whose entire purpose is an independent
  check of sloads' inertia "proved" that inertia wrong by a factor of 25.4, in a
  file that parses cleanly (2026-08-10 code review, finding **C1**; Imperial
  masked it completely, `length.factor = 1.0`). The number now has a single
  owner — `units.DeliverableUnits.gravity` (`force.factor / mass.factor`) — with
  a drift guard pinning 386.0886 in/s² and 9806.65 mm/s² against quoted figures,
  because a derived expectation would have agreed with the defect. The card
  magnitude is asserted on the parsed card *and* on the `$` header line in both
  systems; the header now states the product `Nz × g` it actually writes. Only SI
  `--export-conm2` output changes; no Imperial byte, and no calc, moves.

- **The empennage carries its own mass at last — every h-tail deck the suite has
  ever shipped was air-only.** `tail_span` read the surface weight from
  `Project.tail_mass` and nothing else, and **no shipped fixture ever set one**,
  so `_surface_weight` returned 0 on all six airplanes while `weight.items`
  carried the tail mass correctly the whole time (`ga6_normal` 42/23 lb,
  `concept_regional_jet` 520/640). Plan 11 decision **B-2** made `weight.items`
  the mass SSOT and step B1 derived `fuselage_mass.stations` from it;
  `TailMassInput` was never brought along. It is now: the new
  `mass_distribution.tail_surface_weight` derives each surface's weight from its
  `htail`/`vtail`-tagged items, `panel_weight_lb` is demoted to an explicit
  override behind `weight_is_override` (exactly as `stations_are_override` did
  for the fuselage), and `tail_reconciliation` reports the difference either way.
  A surface with no tagged item is **named** as a data gap rather than reported
  as weightless.

  Effect on `ga6_normal`'s h-tail surface total: `BAL UP` −30.9 %, `BAL DN`
  **+26.0 %**, `UNCHECKED MAN DN` +3.0 %. The down-load cases grow, which is
  decision T-9's whole point — those are the conditions that size a GA
  horizontal tail.

- **Every exported tail deck was taking the `n = 1.0` fallback.**
  `tail_span._load_factor` read `project.envelope` directly instead of going
  through `select.default_envelope`, the single owner (M2R-8) — and
  `registry.run_all_modules`, which is the path the Export page and the CLI use,
  never assigns `project.envelope`. So every condition reported "names no V-n
  point" and took `n = 1.0`, understating the h-tail inertia by up to **3.8×** on
  exactly the balancing cases that size the surface. Invisible while the surface
  weight was always zero; a wrong number the moment it was not. Found while
  closing the item above, and swept with it per `CLAUDE.md` practice 4.

- **`balance.fin_sets` would have applied the fin's mass twice.** An assembled
  lateral case accounts for fin mass in its closure field through the
  `VTAIL`-tagged items (decision L-8), so the applied aerodynamic set it reads
  from `tail_span` must be air only — which `WingStationLoad.fz` silently
  stopped being once the fin gained inertia. The strip's inertia is now carried
  separably as `f_inertia` and the applied set takes `fz - f_inertia`. Caught by
  a pinned number; it now has a gate that says what it means.

- **Concentrated wing masses no longer smear to the nearest node in the
  exported bending** ([plan 14](docs/30_future/14_concentrated_wing_mass_nodal_split_plan.md),
  decision **D-1**). WINGINER adds an engine/gear/fuel/store mass to the
  cumulative bending at its *true* spanwise station, but the sbeam export
  recovers nodal loads by differencing the cumulative shear — so the mass was
  picked up whole at the node inboard of it and its lever arm moved inboard by
  up to one strip width. Shear telescoped exactly; **bending did not**. A deck
  for a twin sized wing structure to a root bending moment ~2 % above the
  NETLOADS value printed beside it.

  The lost first moment turns out to be recoverable **from the published table
  alone** — no new input, no schema change. The per-station defect
  `δ[k] = mxx[k] − mxx[k+1] − sz[k+1]·dy` is identically zero wherever the
  lumped-at-nodes recursion built the column (which is how both `airloads` and
  the panel part of `wing_inertia` build it) and equals exactly `w·(y_c − y[j])`
  at the one station bracketing the mass. It is restored as an applied **offset
  couple** on that node's `MOMENT` card: a force at `y_c` is statically
  equivalent to that force at node `j` plus that couple, so nothing moves and the
  exported set now reproduces the cumulative shear **and** bending at *every*
  node, not merely at the root.

  Measured, root bending before → after: `atr42_100` +1.91 % → exact,
  `dhc8_dash8` +1.11 % → exact, `concept_heavy` +0.44 % → exact. The **`Mzz`
  in-plane channel carried the same defect, unfiled and ungated** (+1.14 /
  +0.67 / +0.32 %) and is swept with it. `δ` is machine-zero on every wing
  without concentrated masses, so the BDF decks of `ga6_normal`, `cessna_210`
  and `concept_regional_jet` are **byte-identical** and no Appendix A oracle is
  touched (no calc file changed).


- **The assembled balanced deck was not in the Imperial baseline.** Found while
  changing the closure field: the 6-DOF rewrite moved every closure card in every
  assembled deck and no digest noticed, because `tests/imperial_baseline.py` only
  ever rendered the per-component channels. Plan 11 acceptance #5 — *"if a digest
  moves, something leaked"* — cannot mean anything for a deliverable that has no
  digest, and the assembled deck is the mission's aim-2 deliverable. Now covered
  (`sbeam/balanced_deck`, 297 channels across six fixtures). Every other Imperial
  channel is **byte-unchanged** by B8a-2, verified before regeneration.

- **The vertical tail was modelled on the waterline datum, not on the airplane**
  (mission phase 4 step 8, [plan 13](docs/30_future/13_b8a_lateral_closure_plan.md)
  step **B8a-1**, decision **L-1**). `tail_span` computed the fin's root
  waterline and then discarded it, passing `z_offset = 0` for the v-tail, so
  every fin's `GRID` cards ran from `z = 0` to its span. On `ga6_normal` that put
  the fin's load centroid at `z = 28.5` against a CG at 93 — **64.5 in below its
  own centre of gravity** — and on `concept_regional_jet` within 1 in of it.

  Nothing shipped consumed the fin's roll arm, so no delivered number was wrong;
  but the roll moment a side load makes about the CG is `−Fy·(z − z_cg)`, and
  B8a's lateral balanced cases are built on it. Measured after the fix, both fins
  sit above the CG at the arms plan 13 §5.1 predicted: `ga6_normal` **+14.0 in**,
  `concept_regional_jet` **+86.0 in**.

  - **One owner, because there were already two** — `tail_geometry.fin_root_waterline`
    resolves the fin root (explicit input → the T-tail relation → the fuselage
    top → a zero that says so, loudly), and both the load path **and the
    three-view** read it. `configuration.tail_planform` had its own copy of the
    formula; on `concept_regional_jet` that drew the fin tip 18 in above the
    horizontal tail it is supposed to carry. Registered in `CONVENTIONS.md` §7
    with a drift guard that fails if either grows a private copy again.
  - **The T-tail branch is not a new convention.** It is the inverse of the
    three-view's own default, which places a T-tail's horizontal surface at the
    fin tip; solving that relation for the root is what keeps the two in contact
    when `h_tail_z` is entered rather than defaulted.
  - Every fixture's fin root, and ga6's and the RJ's roll arms, are **pinned per
    fixture** — including a sign assertion, since the sign is what was wrong.


### Changed

- **`app/` joined the lint gate, and the repository root was cleaned for the
  cut** (review **m19–m21**). The merge gate was `ruff check sloads/ cli.py`,
  which left the whole Streamlit layer unlinted — and it had drifted: an unused
  `build_tail_span` import sat in `export_report.py`. The gate is now
  `ruff check sloads/ cli.py app/` in CI and in every document that states it.
  Alongside: `.DS_Store` is gitignored (and untracked at the cut);
  `CODE_REVIEW_2026-07-21.md` and `PROJECT_REVIEW_2026-07-19.md` moved from the
  root to `docs/50_reviews/`, which is their home, and are indexed there;
  `requirements.txt` is **deleted** rather than regenerated — it was a second
  dependency source that had already drifted from `pyproject.toml` (streamlit
  ≥1.30 vs ≥1.36, listing pytest, omitting plotly and openpyxl), and one source
  that is right beats two that disagree. `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §1 now points at
  `sloads/models/project.py` for `SCHEMA_VERSION` (it named the pre-M3-1
  `sloads/models.py`), and the pyproject classifiers list 3.9 / 3.11 / 3.12 —
  the CI matrix — instead of claiming 3.9 alone.

- **The assembled deck's `SUBCASE` ids are minted from the case, not from its
  position.** 0.5.0 row 1 — decision **D-R7**, review finding **m1**. The
  flagship deliverable was the last deck family still numbering
  `BALANCED_SID_BASE + i`, which is exactly the instability M4-2 decision 8
  removed everywhere else: one condition dropping out of the set (a missing V-n
  point, a payload loading that will not derive) renumbered every case after it,
  so `SUBCASE 5007` meant nothing without the run that produced it. New
  `case_ids.balanced_subcase_id` mints `block + subcase_id`, the block naming
  the hand — symmetric `5000`, starboard `7000`, port `8000`, so `W-05R` is
  `7105` and its port twin `8105` in every run of every project that assembles
  them. `6000` is skipped deliberately: it is this same deck's own GID range.
  Handedness is a block rather than a suffix because a `SUBCASE` id is an
  integer and `7105L` is not one.
  - Minting can collide where positional numbering could not, so
    `balanced_deck.case_sids` **refuses** two cases that share one case id and
    hand rather than letting the solver sum two load sets under one `SUBCASE`.
  - The three blocks are registered bands (`export/bands.py`) pinned against
    `case_ids.BALANCED_HAND_BLOCK` by `tests/test_bands.py`, and the survival
    property is a test in its own right: drop a case from the middle of the set
    and the deck writes every survivor under the number it had.
  - A case carrying no `CaseRef` at all (a bare list built in a test — nothing
    the suite assembles) still falls back to its position, in the separate
    `5001-5100` band so it can never land on a minted id.
  - `sbeam_bridge`'s case-index `SUBCASE` column now maps a handed id through
    the same minting instead of printing an empty cell (no shipped bytes move:
    no handed id reaches the index today).
  - **Byte-changing**: the two balanced-deck digests in
    `tests/fixtures_imperial/digests.json` are regenerated for this and no other
    reason; every other Imperial digest is unchanged.
- **The balanced deck's nodes moved out of the tail-span range: `4001/4201/4401`
  → `6001/6201/6401`** (the F-C1 fix). Node **numbering** only — the
  reconstructed pre-fix deck is byte-identical to the shipped one, and the two
  balanced-deck digests in `tests/fixtures_imperial/digests.json` are regenerated
  for that reason and no other; every other Imperial digest is unchanged.
- **The two chordwise writers share their tributary arithmetic** (review
  **m6**): `_tail_nodal_forces` and `_control_nodal_forces` had the
  trapezoid-width-times-pressure-then-rescale loop written out twice, verbatim.
  One `_trapezoid_tributary_forces` now owns it — which is also the single place
  backlog row 3's degenerate-profile raise will need to land.


- **A balanced case now closes in six degrees of freedom, with one rigid-body
  field** (mission phase 4 step 8, [plan 13](docs/30_future/13_b8a_lateral_closure_plan.md)
  step **B8a-2**, decisions **L-2**/**L-3**). The relief is the d'Alembert field
  `f = −m(a_cg + ω̇ × r)`, written once in the new `sloads/rigid_body.py`. It
  replaces four hand-rolled one-component slices of the same field — each correct
  as far as it went, each missing the companion force component that makes the
  moment it produces equal `−[I]{ω̇}` rather than `−Σw·d²`.

  **The three omissions were worth 0.08 %, 20 % and 55 % of their own degree of
  freedom**, which is the argument for writing the field once rather than adding
  a fifth special case:

  - **pitch** gained `fx = −w·q̈·dz`. The companion is negligible, but the pitch
    inertia stopped being `Σw·dx²`, so **`q̈` fell 18–22 % on `ga6_normal`** and
    3–4 % on `concept_regional_jet`. The deck barely moved (pitch relief is
    0.06–0.56 % of a peak node load); the reported acceleration did, towards the
    truth;
  - **roll** gained `fy = +w·ṗ·dz` — **89.8 lb at a peak node on `ga6_normal`,
    551.9 lb on the RJ**, larger than the roll term already in the deck, because
    `fz = −w·ṗ·dy` reaches only the wing strips (every database item sits at
    `y = 0`) while the companion reaches every mass off the roll axis. A roll
    acceleration throws a mass above the roll axis sideways; the shipped model
    could not say so;
  - **yaw** is new, is coupled to roll through `Ixz`, and gives `ACRL` an induced
    yaw of **+18.93 deg/s²** (ga6) / **−0.993** (RJ). A rolling airplane with
    non-zero `Ixz` yaws.

  The three rotational DOF are now **one 3×3 solve**, not three ratios: `Ixz` is
  8.4 % of the ga6's pitch inertia and larger on the RJ, so treating them as
  independent would be wrong rather than approximate. A singular tensor raises
  rather than pseudo-inverting. All six DOF close to **≤ 2e-16 of `n·W`**.

  - **Item self-inertia now reacts** (decision **L-3**): a mass the assembly
    carries as a *point* applies its own `−[I_self]{ω̇}` as a free moment —
    13.3 % of `ga6_normal`'s `Izz`, and the reason `Izz(closure)` comes out at
    **2933.5 slug-ft²**, matching to 0.0 % the identity `Izz(WTONECG) − wing
    self-Izz + Σw·y²(spread)`. A mass the assembly *spreads* does not, or the
    spread is counted twice; the predicate has one owner
    (`mass_distribution.assembly_distributes_mass`) and a drift guard.
  - **`BalancedCaseResult`** gains `delta_ny` and `closure_inertia`, and
    `delta_pitch`/`delta_roll` become the accelerations they are:
    `p_dot`/`q_dot`/`r_dot`. Result-only fields — nothing on disk has this shape,
    so `SCHEMA_VERSION` stays at **43**.
  - **The B7 roll gate was restated, not weakened.** WINGINER's wing-only model
    reacts 100 % of the aileron moment on the span; the assembled airplane reacts
    about a fifth of it elsewhere, so the old equality could not survive. The
    gate now asserts the *shape* strip-for-strip (unchanged, `rel = 1e-9`) **and**
    pins the magnitude ratio — the wing span's share of the roll moment,
    **0.795230** ga6 / **0.769455** RJ — which the equality could not see at all.


- The balanced-case pitch-residual ceiling is now stated **per family** as well
  as per fixture (`symmetric` / `lateral`) rather than widened. The lateral cases
  sit at V-n points the symmetric families never visit, and their pitch residual
  is larger there (`ga6_normal` `SUDDEN RUDDER` 0.341 %, the RJ's `SIDE GUST`
  1.586 % — the largest instance yet of the already-filed "RJ low-CL cases exceed
  the 1 % pitch gate" item). Keeping the symmetric bounds where they were
  preserves their bite; one widened number would have let a real symmetric
  regression through.
- Imperial baseline digests regenerated for **`csv/balance`**, **`txt/balance`**
  and **`sbeam/balanced_deck`** on `ga6_normal` and `concept_regional_jet` — the
  eight new lateral cases and the lateral columns. No other channel moved on any
  fixture: every per-component deck is byte-identical and every Appendix A oracle
  is unchanged.
- Imperial baseline digests regenerated for **`sbeam/vtail_span_cards`** and
  **`txt/tail_span`** on the five fixtures with a modelled fin — the v-tail deck
  `GRID` waterlines and the in-band notes. No other channel moved: the wing,
  body, h-tail and control decks are byte-identical and every Appendix A oracle
  is unchanged.
- The per-component v-tail deck's "no inertia" note now states the reason of
  record ([plan 13](docs/30_future/13_b8a_lateral_closure_plan.md) decision
  **L-8**): fin inertia belongs to a balanced case, because `n_y` is a property
  of the case and not of a single-condition view — replacing "the suite has no
  lateral load factor", which will stop being true at B8a-3.
- **The backlog is reorganized around a single priority table** (user-agreed
  2026-08-09, [`docs/30_future/00_backlog.md`](docs/30_future/00_backlog.md)):
  every open item, [E] and [V] alike, ranked in one order of work driven by the
  primary deliverable — sbeam (NASTRAN-style) `FORCE`/`MOMENT` cards for the
  wing, body and tail load cases. Agreed ordering rules: wrong cards outrank
  missing cards; landing follows directly after the tail; completed rows are
  **removed** on closure per the lifecycle rule. Historic step numbers are kept
  in item names for plan traceability.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added

- **Distributed empennage loads** — `sloads/modules/tail_span.py`,
  `sloads/tail_geometry.py`, spanwise decks in `sbeam_bridge`, and a **Tail Span
  Loads** page (mission phase 4 step 7; [plan 09](docs/30_future/09_distributed_empennage_loads_plan.md)
  **T1–T5**, phase 1). The tail finally has what the wing has had all along: a
  load at every span station, on a stated load reference axis, that a beam model
  can be sized from. The chordwise TAILDIST profile and every Appendix A figure
  are **unchanged** — this is a pure consumer of SELECT's totals.

  - **Analytic closure gates, because there is no oracle.** Appendix A gives tail
    totals and a chordwise profile and stops. The chord-proportional shape makes
    every target closed-form instead: force to `LT25+LT50` exactly, root bending
    to `L_half·ȳ` with `ȳ` the planform area centroid, torsion to the
    area-weighted chordwise means, inertia to `−n·W`, and the LRA reduction
    identity. All six are checked against a **tapered and swept** planform as
    well, since every shipped fixture takes a derived rectangle.
  - **The horizontal tail is one full-span beam**, tip to tip through the
    centreline, reacted at fuselage attachment stations — not a semispan table
    doubled. That is what lets FAR **23.427(a)**'s unsymmetrical condition live in
    one deck, and it buys a closure a per-side deck cannot state: the net moment
    about the centreline is **identically zero for every symmetric case** and the
    asymmetry moment for 23.427(a).
  - **Tail inertia is d'Alembert — `−n·W`, signed by the load factor alone.** The
    intuitive "inertia opposes the air load" is wrong here and wrong in the
    unconservative direction: the conditions that size a GA horizontal tail are
    *down*-load ones, so an opposing rule would relieve exactly them. A test
    asserts the increase.
  - **The vertical tail is not the horizontal tail rotated.** It spans `z`, its
    air load is a **side force `fy`**, and its torsion is about its own span axis
    — `mzz`, with the sign reversed. One owner in `export/coordinates.py`, because
    the h-tail's convention copy-pasted onto the fin gives a deck that parses,
    solves, and twists the fin the wrong way.
  - **Planform derived where absent, and marked.** No fixture carries tail
    polylines, so a rectangular planform is derived from the authoritative
    area/span and flagged `assumed` everywhere it travels — result, page, CSV,
    deck header — with the cost quantified: a real tapered tail carries its load
    further inboard, so a derived planform is conservative in root bending but its
    station distribution is not the surface's own. Entered polylines win, and are
    validated against the scalars to 1 %.
  - Gated three ways: the closed-form closures, two new rows in the export
    equilibrium sweep (every fixture × both unit systems), and a solver leg in the
    sbeam round-trip harness.
  - `SCHEMA_VERSION` **42** — `Project.tail_mass`, `LoadsResult.htail_span`/
    `.vtail_span`, and `WingStationLoad.myy_free` (the *free* per-strip torsion,
    which the cumulative `myy` is not). All additive; no migration hop.


- **M3-3b / Step G8 — the consolidated summary report renders.** A loads bundle
  now ships its **controlling document**: the airplane and its inputs, the three
  envelope figures with their corner-point tables, the case index and FAR 23
  Subpart C coverage matrix, every governing **ULTIMATE** load with the safety
  factor and station it acts at, the methods & limitations statement, and a
  manifest of the companion files. Four new pure modules — `report/content.py`
  (`Project` → `ReportDocument`), `report/latex.py` (`.tex`), `report/plots_tex.py`
  (V-n, weight/CG and the new speed–altitude figure as pgfplots source) — plus
  `export/pdf.py`, the one impure piece (engine discovery `tectonic` → `latexmk` →
  `pdflatex`, overridable with `SLOADS_TEX_ENGINE`; it returns a log instead of
  raising, because decision G8-1 makes the `.tex` the deliverable and the PDF
  best-effort). Available from the Export page's **Summary report** section and
  headless via `cli.py --report out.tex|out.pdf`. The document honours the
  selected unit system throughout (M4-20), states its basis and units on the title
  page, and is byte-identical between two renders of one project — a caller
  supplies the timestamp, nothing reads the clock.

  The Export page and the report now build their component loads through one
  shared `report.content.component_loads()`, so a bundle's document and its
  CSV/BDF files cannot describe different numbers. Sections whose inputs are
  absent say so with a reason rather than vanishing or rendering an empty table.


- **M4-9 — a standing relabel guard** (`tests/test_report.py`). Three tests
  replace every display label with a meaningless one and require the load-case
  CSV, the schema choice and the four gyro sub-cases to be unaffected — the
  regression the whole item exists to prevent. Each was verified to fail when its
  own code path is reverted to label matching.
- **M4-9 — `sloads/load_keys.py`**, the canonical `LoadValue.key` constants for
  the load-case schema (`loc_x`, `fz_vertical`, `fy_side`, `fx_thrust`,
  `mx_mount_torque`, and the `gyro_case{n}_{myy,mzz}` sub-cases), imported by
  both producer and consumer.
- **M4-9 — schema v37 backfill hop** (`migrations._v36_load_value_keys`). The
  persisted SELECT critical conditions get their keys filled from a frozen
  label→key table; an unrecognised label keeps an empty key rather than an
  invented one. M4-10's fields-hash tripwire fired on the shape change, as built.
- **M4-10 — two schema guards** (`tests/test_schema_guards.py`). A **sentinel
  round-trip** walks every persisted scalar of a real project and asserts none is
  dropped by `io.py`'s hand-written field lists — the failure mode where a new
  field works perfectly in memory and in every calc test, then vanishes on
  save/reload. And a **fields-hash tripwire** over every persisted dataclass's
  field names, so changing a persisted shape without bumping `SCHEMA_VERSION` now
  fails loudly; the discipline was previously unenforced. The tripwire is itself
  tested by injecting a change and asserting it fires.


- **M4-11a — `components.unit_number_input`: the GUI input unit boundary, in one
  place.** Imperial in, Imperial out, so a view cannot convert twice, convert the
  wrong way, or forget to convert on the way home. Three modes, stated by the
  caller and never inferred from a label: `kind=` (converted; unit-suffixed
  label, per-system widget key, bounds converted too), `fixed_unit=KEAS` /
  `ALTITUDE_FT` (decision D-16's aviation carve-out — displayed, never converted,
  key deliberately *not* per-system), or neither (dimensionless). Both together
  raise `ValueError`.
- **M4-11a — `components.page_header(key)` / `page(key)`**: a view's title,
  caption, applicability banner and `PageContext` in one call, with `page()`
  adding a workflow-derived upstream gate as a context manager. The title *and*
  the required slices come from `workflow.py`, and each gate links to the step
  that produces the missing slice, so re-sequencing the workflow re-points every
  gate without touching a view.
- **M4-11a — `components.active_system()`**, the single read of the unit
  selection in the whole app layer (D-16); backlog M4-20 re-points that one
  function at a `Project` field without touching any call site.
- **M4-11a — two new test files, 50 tests.**
  `tests/test_app_components.py` pins the helper in isolation (round-trip per
  unit kind per system, carve-out exactness, bound conversion, key discipline);
  `tests/test_view_unit_roundtrip.py` pins it end-to-end through real views via
  `AppTest`, typing in each system and asserting the same stored Imperial value.
- **`radon`** added to the `dev` extra (decision D-17) for cyclomatic-complexity
  and maintainability-index reporting. **Explicitly not a CI gate** — `ruff` and
  `pytest` remain the merge gate.


- **Step G8 specification & plan (M3-3, the first M4 item) — docs only, no code.**
  The consolidated loads summary report is now specified before it is built:
  `docs/10_standard/SUMMARY_REPORT.md` is the **document standard** (purpose and
  audience, whole-document content rules — ultimate-load marking, case-ID
  traceability, axis/sign/station statements, absence handling, units — the
  required section structure, the **excluded-content** list with the reason for
  each exclusion, and an eleven-point conformance checklist), and
  `docs/30_future/05_step_g8_summary_report_plan.md` is the implementation plan
  (locked decisions G8-1…G8-4: a LaTeX renderer emitting `.tex` always and PDF
  when a TeX engine is present, pgfplots/TikZ figures generated as text, the
  methods/limitations statement stamped into BDF `$` comments + CSV `#` headers +
  `METHODS.txt` + a workbook sheet, and report depth = summary plus every
  governing case pointing at the bundle's CSV/BDF companions; the `sloads/report/`
  package layout; seven ordered sub-steps; risks; the test matrix). The backlog
  entry and `docs/00_INDEX.md` link both. No calc, module or export code changed.
- **`cspell.json` — the domain wordlist referenced by `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`
  and `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` now actually exists.** 119 verified terms (the 21 `.BAS`
  program names, structural/aero vocabulary, the suite's variable and unit
  abbreviations, tooling names, and the LaTeX toolchain terms Step G8 will need),
  plus `ignorePaths` for the venv, caches, `reference/` PDFs and generated data
  files. Entries were checked against the repo rather than assumed, so no
  misspelling is whitelisted.

- **M4-18 — the loads reference axis (LRA) + two-sided load envelopes**
  (2026-08-03 loads-plots review). Two review findings closed:
  1. **Wing torsion is now stated about a defined loads reference axis.**
     New `SurfaceInput.ref_axis_pct` (schema v34, lenient default 0.25) names
     the chordwise axis of the beam model the delivered loads apply to — the
     elastic axis, typically 40–50 % chord. The calc stays on the original
     25 % chord (oracle-locked); `net_loads.to_loads_ref_axis` transfers the
     cumulative torsion at the render/export boundary
     (`Myy_lra = Myy_25 + Sz·(x_lra − x_25)`; a bitwise no-op at 0.25), and
     `WingLoadResult.torsion_axis` stamps the axis on every result. **Every
     torsion output now names its axis** (mixed axes stay allowed but always
     labelled): the Loads-Plots/Export pages and the sbeam artifacts deliver
     LRA torsion (in-band span-CSV `MyyAxis` column + BDF `$` comments +
     stick-model beam-axis note), the Wing Loads analysis page and
     `wing_load_rows` stay at the labelled 25 % chord for manual cross-checks,
     and `net_loads.run` reports the root torsion at both axes when they
     differ. The LRA is set per surface on the Geometry page (with definition
     help text, seed carry-over) and drawn dash-dot on the three-view planform.
  2. **The Loads-Plots envelope is now two-sided.** The single max-|value|
     trace hid the opposite-sign extreme (which can govern a different part of
     the structure) and could jump where the governing sign flips; the overlay
     now draws pointwise **max and min** envelopes (`report.envelope_extremes`)
     and writes both into the page's CSV download.

- **M4-17e — the full 33-case LANDLOAD matrix in the ULTIMATE deliverable.**
  `landing.run()` now emits **40** `ConditionResult`s (LGFACTOR + 6 family
  summaries + 33 per-case): VMP/DMP/SMP/RMP and VNP/DNP/SNP/RESULT
  (`lbs-ULT`, SF 1.5), the unbalanced pitch/roll/yaw moments (`lb-in-ULT`,
  SF 1.5) and the **dimensionless** ground-line inertia factors NVP/NDP/NS
  (unscaled, no `-ULT` — they are load factors). The moments and factors — a
  third of the original LANDLOAD printout, computed since the port but reaching
  no deliverable and no test — are also shown on the Landing Loads page
  (LIMIT-marked) and are the gear-attachment inputs **M4-6** needs. The CSV grows
  from 7 conditions to ~430 rows, so the deliverable is no longer thinner than
  the LIMIT analysis screen.
- **M4-17d — landing hierarchy & sanity validation** in the pure
  `sloads/validation.py`: `gross_ge_max_landing` (WR = GW/W below 1
  under-predicts the braked-roll, side and supplementary-nose cases),
  `landing_light_le_max`, `landing_cg_ordering`, `landing_cg_below_axle`,
  `landing_cg_names`; plus a post-compute `landing_reaction_warnings`
  (`landing_negative_vertical`, `landing_zero_nose`) kept **outside**
  `consistency_warnings` so no definition page pays for a gear solve. Warn-only,
  and silent on the Appendix-A GA fixture.

### Fixed

- **The round-trip harness's determinate support was implicitly x-axis-only.**
  It constrained rotation about `x`, which restrains a beam running along `x` —
  the fuselage and chordwise-tail decks. The h-tail's spanwise deck is the first
  beam in the suite to run along `y`, and it came back *exactly singular*: the
  model was free to spin about its own axis. The support now picks its
  axial-rotation DOF from the beam's direction. A latent defect in step 2's
  machinery that only a non-`x` beam could find.

- **Antisymmetric (rolling) balanced cases, and the handedness machinery** —
  `modules/balance.py`, the reflection operator in `export/coordinates.py`
  (mission phase 3 step 6; plan 11 **B7**, decisions B-6/B-7). An accelerated-roll
  case now assembles as a full-span airplane, and every asymmetric family from
  here on inherits its left/right twin for free.

  **Only `ACRL` is antisymmetric, which was measured rather than assumed.**
  Handedness lives entirely in `unbal_moment` (FAR 23.349), and every fixture
  enters zero for `TORS` — a *steady* roll has no unbalanced moment, the aileron
  being balanced by roll damping. `TORS` is therefore assembled as the symmetric
  case it is, and a test pins the finding so a fixture that ever enters a rolling
  `TORS` goes red instead of being assembled symmetrically and meaning nothing.

  **The roll residual is not an error, and is not gated like one.** On a rolling
  case `residual_mx` is the *applied* aileron couple — 6.71 % of n·W·b/2 on ga6,
  2.00 % on the RJ — which the airplane is supposed not to balance. It is reacted
  in full by a fourth closure degree of freedom, roll acceleration, distributed
  over every mass; the same standing `nx` already has for drag, because nothing
  else in a free-free model can react either.

  **That relief reproduces WINGINER's own unit-roll distribution, strip for
  strip, ratio 1.000000 on both fixtures** — the wing-item/panel scale cancelling
  identically. Two producers, one answer: oracle-locked FAR 23 code and a residual
  solve that knows nothing about it. That identity is the step's closure gate,
  standing in for the printed oracle concept mode does not have. All six DOF then
  close to machine precision, and both twins solve in the real sbeam with
  reactions ≈ 0.

  **Twins by reflection, not recomputation.** `y → −y`, with a force mirrored as
  a true vector and a moment as an axial one — so roll and yaw reverse and pitch
  does not. One owner in `export/coordinates.py` with an involution drift guard,
  because a sign convention copied to a second call site is what produces a deck
  that parses, solves, and sizes structure to a load the airplane never sees.
  Handedness is a suffix on the existing case id (`W-05L`/`W-05R`), not a new ID
  series; a symmetric case has no hand and gets no twin.

  **Limitation, stated in-band:** the aileron's own spanwise lift increment is not
  distributed — the schema has aileron *areas* and no butt lines — so the couple
  is lumped at the wing aerodynamic centre. This reduces *exactly* to the
  oracle-locked model, which likewise carries only the inertia reaction, but
  `ACRL` wing bending omits the differential lift itself. Filed on the backlog,
  and printed in the deck header, the case notes and the Balanced Cases page.

- **The exported decks are solved in the real sbeam, in CI** —
  `sloads/export/roundtrip.py`, `tests/test_sbeam_roundtrip.py`, the `solver`
  extra and the `sbeam-roundtrip` CI job (mission phase 1 step 2;
  [plan 10](docs/30_future/10_sbeam_roundtrip_ci_harness_plan.md)). The mission's
  claim is that a concept configuration's loads come out as a deck **that
  solves**. That was verified once, by hand, and nothing had re-checked it since.

  It is now a standing gate over `ga6_normal` + `concept_regional_jet` ×
  {Imperial, SI}, and the assertions that matter have two independent producers:
  - the **wing** stick deck's reaction and its element-1 end-B internal loads are
    compared against the NETLOADS quadrature — different code from the cards;
  - the **fuselage** deck's entire Ch 15 cumulative shear and bending table is
    reassembled by sbeam from the `FORCE` cards and `GRID` coordinates alone;
  - the **tail** deck's total and chordwise first moment;
  - the **assembled full-span deck** — the primary deliverable — is solved, and
    all six reaction components at its determinate support come out zero. That
    is the free-free claim proved through a solver's own assembly, on the lever
    arms it derives from the deck rather than the ones sloads used.

  Body and tail are solved through a **test-only** stick wrapper that supplies
  elements from the deck's own `GRID` cards; it is never written by the CLI or
  the GUI, and no exported byte changed in this step. Control-surface decks stay
  permanently out of scope — a chord *fraction* is not geometry.

  **The gate is shown to bite**: three mutation tests assert it fails — a wing
  `FORCE` card scaled by 1.01, two `SUBCASE`s' `LOAD` ids swapped, and one body
  `GRID` displaced by 1 %, which leaves every force sum in the deck closing
  exactly and can only be caught by solving.

  sbeam enters as a **pinned** optional extra (`pip install -e '.[solver]'`), so
  an unrelated sbeam commit can never redden an unrelated sloads PR; a weekly
  non-blocking `sbeam drift` workflow tracks its `main` so drift is visible
  without gating. Without sbeam installed the gate skips; the CI job sets
  `SLOADS_REQUIRE_SBEAM=1` so a broken install fails instead of reporting green.

- **Balanced free-free airplane cases** — `sloads/modules/balance.py`,
  `sloads/export/balanced_deck.py`, and a **Balanced Cases** page (mission phase 3
  step 5; plan 11 **B2–B6**). The mission's aim 2: *a full airplane balanced case,
  wing tip to wing tip, nose to tail, with no need for a constraint, because the
  loads balance.*

  The airplane has always balanced at **trim** (`LZW + LT = Nz·W`, asserted for a
  long time). What never inherited that balance was the **distributed** load set —
  the wing distribution, the tail load, the fuselage inertia and the trim solve
  were four calculations nothing assembled. They are assembled now, and every case
  states what was left over.

  Achieved on the fixtures that can produce one: pre-closure residuals of
  **0.05–0.70 % of n·W** in force and **0.12–1.04 % of n·W·MAC** in pitch, against
  plan 11's 1 % gate — and after closure all three symmetric degrees of freedom
  come to zero at machine precision, verified again by re-deriving the resultant
  from the exported deck's own card text.

- **The assembled full-span deck is now the primary loads deliverable** (decision
  B-5). Both wings on separate GID bands (`4001+` / `4201+` — the first deck in
  the suite carrying more than a half-span), a determinate six-DOF support whose
  recovered reaction *is* the residual, and a `$` header stating the pre-closure
  residual, the relief applied, and that the fuselage `Cm` is lumped. Verified to
  parse with sbeam's own reader.


- **CONM2 / MASSSET mass export** — `sloads/export/mass_cards.py`, the mass
  channel on `DeliverableUnits`, and `cli.py --export-conm2` (mission phase 2
  step 4; plan 12 C1–C5). The `FORCE`/`MOMENT` deck is the *total* applied load
  and stays that way, but its inertia half is computed by the same code that
  writes it, so nothing outside sloads could contradict it. The mass model now
  exports as `CONM2` cards with one `MASSSET` per derivable payload case, so
  sbeam parses the masses independently and can disagree.
  - **Three artifacts**: a pasteable `CONM2`+`MASSSET` fragment; a self-contained
    runnable mass-check deck (`MASSSET` + `GRAV`, a massless placeholder beam,
    and **no load cards at all**); and sloads' own inertia contribution as a
    separate, clearly-marked comparison set.
  - **Not double-counting inertia is structural, not a warning** (C-6): the
    check deck carries no `FORCE`/`MOMENT` cards by construction, which is a
    property a test asserts. Applying the total set *and* accelerating the masses
    reads as a heavier airplane rather than a crash, which is why it is ruled out
    rather than flagged.
  - **`DeliverableUnits` gains `mass` and `mass_inertia`** with their own
    dimensional identity, `force / (mass × length) == g`, exact and *identical*
    in both systems (one standard gravity, expressed per length unit and derived
    from a single constant). `CONM2`'s `M` is mass while the database stores
    weight, so a set written from the human channel is wrong by 386× in a file
    that parses cleanly — the writer refuses it, as the moment channel already
    does.
  - **Verified against sbeam itself** (2026-08-08, by hand — sbeam is not a
    dependency, so CI cannot run it): both decks parse with sbeam's own reader,
    and its grid-point-weight generator reproduces sloads' mass, CG-x and CG-z
    for all four ga6 payload cases exactly.

- **Per-payload-case itemization** — `mass_distribution.derive_case_loadings`.
  Each `flight_loads.cg_cases` entry is resolved to an actual loading (which
  discretionary items are aboard, plus a ballast row solved from the case's
  weight, xcg and zcg), so the mass model can be exported per case rather than
  once. A case is exported only when the required ballast is credible; the rest
  are reported with the number and the reason.


- **The mass single source of truth** — `sloads/mass_distribution.py` (mission
  phase 2 step 3; plan 11 decision **B-2**, step B1). The suite carried **two
  mass models that never reconciled**: the itemized `weight.items` database, and
  a short hand-entered `fuselage_mass.stations` lump table which was the only
  input the Ch 15 fuselage beam ever read. Nothing compared them, and the entered
  table was short on **every** shipped fixture — ga6 492 lb (16 % of the beam),
  cessna_210 430, dhc8_dash8 2,810, atr42_100 7,541 (23 %),
  concept_regional_jet 12,600 (41 %), and concept_heavy had no table at all. Every
  fuselage inertia load, shear, bending moment and exported body card was computed
  from a beam carrying less mass than the airplane weighed.

  The item database is now authoritative and the beam is **derived** from it.
  `MassItem.component` tags which structural component carries each item;
  `mass_distribution` partitions the database, builds the station table, and owns
  the reconciliation checks. The beam carries everything except the wing — the
  empennage included, since it hangs off the aft fuselage — while the wing enters
  as the carry-through *reaction*, never as mass (plan 11 §4's seam rule).

- **`concept_heavy` has fuselage loads for the first time.** It carries no
  `fuselage_mass.stations`, and that was the only reason it had no body deck;
  16,200 lb of airplane had no fuselage distribution. A project no longer needs a
  hand-entered station table to have a fuselage. It is now the sixth of six
  examples reaching the solver channel.


- **Export-boundary equilibrium gate** (`sloads/export/equilibrium.py`, mission
  phase 1 step 1; design note
  `docs/30_future/07_export_equilibrium_invariant_plan.md`). Every exported deck
  states a closure in its `$` header; until now those claims were verified — where
  at all — against *in-memory* objects, by four separately hand-rolled,
  force-only, Imperial-only summations. The new module is the single owner of the
  other half: parse a deck, re-derive Σ`FORCE`/Σ`MOMENT` **from its own card
  text** about a stated reference point, and compare at one tolerance policy
  (`parse_cards`, `card_totals`, `resultant`, `deck_resultants`, `closes`;
  `parse_cards` moved out of `tests/helpers.py`, which re-exports it).
  `tests/test_export_equilibrium.py` sweeps **every shipped example × {Imperial,
  SI} × every deck family** — closing three gaps at once: no moment was ever
  checked from any deck's text (the body deck's "Terminal Myy … (moment
  equilibrium)" header claim had been unverified since C6); `system=` was never
  varied, so a unit set with `moment.factor ≠ force.factor × length.factor` (the
  D-19 failure mode) was invisible to force-only sums; and the ga6 oracle
  fixture's body/tail/control decks had no deck coverage at all. The four
  existing hand-rolled sums in `test_concept_closure.py` / `test_sbeam_bridge.py`
  now go through the same owner.

- **`GRID` cards on the body and tail decks.** Both decks previously named GIDs
  that had no `GRID` card in any file: a consumer could not place the loads
  without a second artifact, and neither deck could be moment-checked from its own
  text. Both now open with a shared station `GRID` block (`y = z = 0` — the
  component's beam line in isolation). Control-surface decks deliberately get
  **none** and say so in-band: `ControlSurfaceStation.x` is a fraction of chord
  and the result carries no chord length, so any coordinate emitted there would be
  silently wrong (revisit if the result ever gains a chord).

- **Design-airspeeds theory document** — new
  `docs/20_theory/design_airspeeds.md`: the STRSPEED/MACHLIM chapter, defining
  the FAR 23.335/23.337 design speeds and load factors (VS/VSF, n, VC, VD, VA,
  VF, MC/MD) with the equations and coefficient schedules as implemented, the two
  25.335(b) dive-speed routes (F25-2) with the margin policy table, the MACHLIM
  Mach lines, and the Subpart-G operating-limitation relationship (the design
  speeds cap the placards; VMO ≤ VC, with equality the usual choice) — plus the
  documented Part 25 gaps (VB/U_ref deferred to F25-1, upset criterion
  backlogged). Appendix A oracle figures tabulated with page citations. Docs
  only; no code change.

- **F25-2 — Part 25 speeds & placards: the 25.335(b) Mach-margin dive-speed route.**
  14 CFR 25.335(b) selects VD by **either** the speed ratio `VC/MC ≤ 0.8·VD/MD`
  (algebraically `VD ≥ 1.25·VC`) **or** a minimum Mach margin between MC and MD;
  23.335(b)(4) has the same "or". The suite only ever implemented the first half.
  `speeds.vd_basis` now picks the route (`speed_ratio` — the default and previous
  behaviour — or `mach_margin`), available in the concept category **"C" only** so
  the Appendix-A-oracle-locked FAR 23 path is provably untouched.
  - **Margin policy has one owner**, `structural_speeds.resolve_mach_margin`:
    default **0.07 M** (the 25.335(b)(2) rule figure since Amdt 25-91, 1997;
    AC 25.335-1A calls it sufficient without further investigation); **0.05–0.07 M
    accepted only with a written rational-analysis basis**
    (`speeds.mach_margin_basis`), flagged in the results, in `validation.py` and
    with a GUI warning that it needs significant justification and represents a
    certification risk; **below 0.05 M refused** (the CFR's absolute floor). The
    floor constrains what may be *declared* — a chosen VD short of the declared
    margin is raised to meet it, like every other design-speed minimum.
  - The M2-10 placard ladder's hardcoded `0.05` is gone: `operational_target_checks`
    now uses the resolved margin, and the placard block reports the implied MC→MD
    margin with a `< 0.07` flag.
  - `speeds.vb_kt` (rough-air speed, 25.335(d)) is accepted and checked for
    25.335(a) ordering against VC. **Input only** — the full `VC ≥ VB + 1.32·U_ref`
    margin needs the 25.341 reference-gust schedule and is deferred to F25-1.
  - Regulation text captured in `reference/14CFR_25_335_design_airspeeds.md`
    (25.335(a)/(b)/(d), verbatim) and `reference/14CFR_MC_MD_speed_margin.md` §5.
  - **Not a sufficiency demonstration, and it says so:** 25.335(b) requires the
    *greater of* the Mach margin and the (b)(1) upset-criterion speed increase;
    only the Mach term is implemented, and every margin-route output states that.

- **M4-5 — aero-coefficient curves + closure on Aerodynamic Data (decision D-10).**
  The page now plots CL–α, the drag polar (CL vs CD) and CM–α for each
  configuration, with the balanced V-n points overlaid and the stall clamps drawn,
  so a coefficient-entry error shows as a shape instead of hiding in a table — the
  concept-aircraft case, where the polynomials are hand-built.
  - New pure module `sloads/aero_curves.py` is the **single authority for
    evaluating** the airplane-less-tail polynomials: `modules/flight_envelope`
    imports `lift_cl`/`drag_cd`/`moment_cm`/`clmax_curve` instead of inlining
    them. The FLTLOADS arithmetic is unchanged bit-for-bit (Glauert passed as
    `(g, gmn)`, not a pre-divided ratio); all Appendix A oracles unmoved.
  - Two closure metrics, gated in CI on the GA oracle and both concept fixtures:
    **recovered CL** (each point's CL re-derived from its own `LZW`/`DX`/α/V by
    inverting the balance rotation, vs the polynomial — a drift guard at 1e-9,
    since the two are algebraically the same number) and the **stall-clamp
    margin** (no balanced point above its Mach-adjusted stall CL by more than the
    balance's 0.005 band).
  - New `sloads.validation` coefficient-entry checks tagged for the page:
    `aero_clmax_unreachable`, `aero_lift_slope_sign`, `aero_drag_negative`,
    `aero_drag_polar_shape`, `aero_clmax_neg_sign`. Advisory only; silent on every
    shipped fixture.
  - `flight_envelope.balance_configs` is now public (the page needs the same
    fuselage-moment-augmented configs the balance flies).


- **Overlay `CONM2` cards no `MASSSET` named were silently counted in every
  payload case.** sbeam decides overlay-only status by *reference* — a card no
  `ADD`/`REPLACE` row names belongs to the baseline mass. The first cut exported
  every discretionary item, including ga6's own `Ballast` row (superseded by the
  per-case ballast this step derives), so sbeam's grid-point-weight generator
  recovered 9.0083 slinch against sloads' 8.8063 for CG1: **78 lb too much, in
  every case, from a deck that parsed without complaint.** Found by running
  sbeam's GPWG over the exported deck rather than by inspection. The overlay list
  is now built from what the loadings actually carry, which makes an unreferenced
  overlay card impossible to write, and `unreferenced_overlay_eids` guards it.


- **Deck `$` comments overran the 72-column free-field card width.** The body deck
  had a one-off assertion of this; the tail deck's "Applied Fz set sums to … =
  SF × (LT25 + LT50) = …" line overran on any five-figure load (73 columns on
  `ga6_normal`) because nothing swept the other families. Fixed for the body,
  tail and control decks and replaced with a swept guard over every example in
  both unit systems. The wing decks overrun too; that fix changes wing Imperial
  bytes and is filed on the backlog rather than folded in here.

- **Concept dive speeds were silently overridden (Major, F25-2).** In concept mode
  the `1.25·VC` floor was applied unconditionally, so a concept user could not
  enter a margin-route VD at all. On `examples/concept_regional_jet.project.json`
  its own `chosen_vd = 350` kt (MD 0.8511, margin +0.097) was overridden to
  387.5 kt → **MD 0.9423, margin +0.189**, inflating every dive-speed case
  (`MAN ±D`, `GUST ±D`, `BAL D`, `ST ROL D`) and cascading into MACHLIM
  (MNE 0.848, **MFC 1.13** — supersonic flutter clearance for a subsonic
  transport). The RJ fixture now ships on the Mach-margin route and its dive-line
  loads **decrease**; MNE 0.766, MFC 1.021. Non-dive cases are numerically
  unchanged, pinned by a new mechanism test. No FAR 23 category is affected.
- **MC/MD had two homes and the front-ends disagreed (F25-2).** `mach_limit.mc`/
  `.md` were persisted in the project file *and* recomputed from the design speeds
  by the Streamlit page, which ignored the stored pair. The registry/CLI path
  honoured it, so the same RJ project reported **MNE 0.738 from the CLI and 0.848
  from the GUI** — breaking the "GUI, CLI and tests are interchangeable
  front-ends" contract. `MachLimitInput.mc/md` are removed; `mach_limit_lines`
  takes MC/MD as arguments and `structural_speeds.design_speed_values` is the sole
  producer, guarded by a new test over every shipped example. MACHLIM output moves
  slightly for the GA fixtures too — their stored MC/MD were the manual's *rounded*
  printed figures (0.323/0.403 vs the derived 0.32264/0.40330); the Appendix A
  oracles still pass at ±0.1 % and no load channel moved.

- **Aerodynamic Data: the fuselage-moment Apply no longer rewrites the CLmax
  scalars** (found while implementing M4-5; same defect class as M4-22). That
  form rebuilt the whole `aero_coeffs` slice without `clmax_clean` /
  `clmax_clean_neg` / `clmax_flap`, so `__post_init__` re-derived them from the
  per-config `stall_cl` — silently moving VS/VSF and hence VA/VF wherever the two
  legitimately differ, and **zeroing `clmax_flap`** on a project with no
  flaps-down coefficient set (the regional-jet concept: VF then failed to
  compute). Pinned by two `AppTest` guards.


- **Twelve views read `st.session_state["unit_system"]` directly**, a second
  authority for the unit selection that decision D-16 says must not exist (found
  implementing M4-20 step 6). It was latent rather than live — `Home.py` rewrites
  the session key from `Project.unit_system` on every render, so the two agree in
  practice — but it meant step 2's re-point of `active_system()` at the project
  field reached only the views that go through `unit_number_input`/`page`. All
  twelve now call `active_system()`, whose own fallback is that same session key.
- **`weight_mass.py` handed `load_cases_csv` its display-converted results.**
  Since M4-20 step 3 the writer converts internally, so that page's CSV came out
  SI while every other page's came out Imperial — an inconsistency no error
  reported. It now passes the raw results plus `system=`; only the unit-agnostic
  `module_text_report` gets the converted copy.
- **The four sbeam `.bdf` decks shipped with no methods or units statement at
  all** (found implementing M4-20 step 5). The Export page built a
  `bdf_comment_block` and then never applied it — the decks were the one channel
  in a bundle carrying neither their ULTIMATE basis nor their unit set. `ruff`
  could not catch it: the unused name is module-level, and its unused-variable
  rule is a *local* check. Every BDF writer now takes `header_comment=` (matching
  the CSV writers), the page passes the stamp it builds, and a source-level test
  asserts all five deck artifacts do. `$` is inert to any bulk-data parser and an
  unstamped call is byte-identical, so no existing caller changes.

- **`lb-in` and `lb/in^2` had no SI conversion.** `units.convert_results` left
  them Imperial while converting everything around them, so an SI results table
  mixed `N` and `lb-in` in adjacent rows with no error anywhere — **1580 values
  across the six examples**, covering root bending/torsion, pitching moments and
  every control-surface design pressure. Both now convert (`N·m`, `kPa`) and both
  are recognised by the ultimate boundary, so they keep their `-ULT` marker. A
  standing guard asserts every unit in `render._LOAD_UNITS` has an SI mapping and
  an `-ULT` marker, so the next one added without them fails loudly; it was
  verified to fail when the `lb-in` row is removed again.
- **Dead `"knot" → m/s` row removed from the SI table.** The calc emits
  `kt(EAS)`, never `"knot"`, so the row never matched a value — the KEAS
  carve-out held by accident. Removing it means the first producer to emit
  `"knot"` cannot silently convert an airspeed the standard says is never
  converted. Pinned by test for both `kt(EAS)` and `ft`.
- **The `lb-in → N·m` factor was quoted twice as a rounded `0.1129848333`** against
  an exact product of `0.11298482902761668`. Both sites now derive it. SI-only,
  3.8e-8, below display precision.


- **M4-10 — a pre-Phase-G0 file lost its horizontal-tail length.** The v24
  unit-rename hop covered `vtail_loads` but not `tail_loads`, so
  `airplane_length_ft` was dropped rather than rescaled to inches. Caught by the
  existing `test_legacy_ft_sqin_keys_migrate_to_canonical`.

- **G8.3 — every export channel now carries its own methods & limitations
  statement.** A loads CSV forwarded on its own, or a BDF handed to sbeam, now
  states in band that its numbers are ULTIMATE, under what category, how the tool
  is verified (including that twin-turboprop cases are **closure-locked, not
  oracle-locked**, because Appendix B is not bundled), the three approved
  deviations from the source manual, and what the tool does not do. Built once in
  `sloads/report/methods.py` and wired into `io.load_cases_csv`, all five sbeam
  CSV writers, the case index, `METHODS.txt` in the zip bundle, and a new
  *Methods* sheet in the workbook. The statement adapts per project: the concept
  caveat lists the actual applicability exceedances, and the fuselage
  closure-artifact caveat appears verbatim only when a case took the fallback
  path. Deterministic — nothing reads the clock, so two exports of one project
  are byte-identical. CSV consumers need `comment="#"`; every in-repo reader was
  audited in the same change.
- **G8.4 — FAR 23 Subpart C coverage matrix** (`sloads/report/coverage.py`): 52
  regulations classified against what a run actually produced — *covered* (with a
  case count), *not applicable* (with the engineering reason), *not analysed*
  (the gap list), or *out of scope* (the tool does not implement it). The
  fourth status is a deliberate departure from the plan's three: without it, the
  16 regulations the suite never implements read as gaps and bury the 9 real ones.
- **G8.2 — document-control fields** `Project.revision` / `.checked_by` /
  `.approved_by` / `.description` (**schema v36**), editable on the Dashboard.
  All free text defaulting to `""`, so older files load unchanged and a project
  that never sets them serialises exactly as before. `revision` is deliberately
  free text, not a tool-managed counter (decision G8-5).


- **`report.strip_comment_lines` corrupted CRLF line endings.** The reader-side
  helper split on `\n` and rejoined, silently rewriting the line endings
  `csv.DictWriter` emits — in the payload it exists to leave untouched.

- **M4-11a — the Geometry page ignored the SI unit toggle on ~40 fields.** The
  empennage (33 fields), landing-gear (7) and engine-CG (3) forms hard-coded
  Imperial unit strings into their labels (`"H-tail area ST (ft²)"`, `"Tread
  between mains (in)"`) and performed no conversion, so with the sidebar set to
  SI a user saw `(in)`/`(ft²)` and their entry was stored as inches. The gear
  caption had documented the behaviour rather than fixed it. All now render in
  the active system and store canonical Imperial. Two `"CG station … (in)"`
  fields on the Flight Envelope trim tab had the same defect.
- **M4-11a — a 184 ft² wing was stored as 1982 ft² in SI.** With the widgets
  returning canonical Imperial, the Geometry page's Apply handler converted a
  second time. Found by the new through-the-view test, not by review.
- **M4-11a — an untouched field drifted the project on every Apply in SI.** The
  display seed is rounded to 4 decimals for legibility; converting *that* back
  returned a value a hair off the original. `unit_number_input` now returns the
  caller's own Imperial value when the field was not edited.
- **M4-11a — `min_value`/`max_value` were not converted with the value**, so a
  non-zero Imperial bound would have become an SI-magnitude bound and silently
  stopped constraining.


- **M4-12a — AppTest Apply buttons are selected by form key, not list
  position.** `at.button` flattens every form's submit button into one list, so
  `test_dirty_flag`'s `_apply_buttons(at)[0]`/`[1]` silently rebound whenever a
  view gained, lost or reordered a form — the test kept passing while asserting
  something else, and M4-11 is about to rewrite 22 apply handlers. All eight
  positional/label lookups (`test_dirty_flag`, `test_configuration_layout_view`,
  `test_landing`) now go through `helpers.apply_button(at, form_key)`, which
  asserts it matched exactly one button. Two `__main__` self-runners that drove
  views through `AppTest` without putting `app/` on `sys.path` are repaired.
  The bad selection had been masking a real app defect, now logged as **M4-22**
  (the Flight Envelope SELECT Apply also persists un-applied geometry edits).

- **M4-1 — fuselage body loads now close the moment, not just the force**
  (Ref 1 Ch 15 p103). `body_loads` applied a single vertical wing reaction and
  closed ΣFz only, so the delivered body beam carried a net pitching couple
  (terminal `Myy` 7.3e4 – 5.5e5 lb-in on the GA6 conditions). It now follows the
  manual's two passes: the terminal moment of the inertia + tail-load set **is**
  the unbalanced moment `M_ub`, which is reacted with the vertical residual at
  the wing **front and rear spar attachments**
  (`R_r = (M_ub + R_total·(x_ref − x_f))/(x_r − x_f)`, `R_f = R_total − R_r`).
  Both residuals now close to ~1e-15 of the loads that produce them. New
  `SurfaceInput.front_spar_pct`/`.rear_spar_pct` (**schema v35**; `None` = not
  entered → module defaults 0.15/0.65, flagged `assumed` on every deliverable)
  and `derived_geometry.carry_through`. The two reactions are applied as the
  statically equivalent **linear line load** over the carry-through rather than
  as two point loads — same resultant and first moment, no `±M_ub/d` shear
  spike, and it collapses onto the manual's literal two-point solve as `d → 0`;
  closure is independent of the node count. Where the spar stations can't be
  derived, a flagged whole-body fallback closes the beam and is labelled a
  **closure artifact** (it has no physical source). Wing-attach fitting loads
  are reported — `body_loads.fitting_load_rows` (LIMIT) and the new
  `sbeam_bridge.body_fitting_load_csv` (ULTIMATE, also in the `.zip` bundle and
  as a workbook sheet) — deliberately *outside* the `FORCE` set, which already
  carries them. The 2026-07-23 caveat comes off its three stamp sites: BDF
  blocks now state both residuals and the spar provenance (`$ CAVEAT:` only on
  the artifact path), the **Net Fuselage Loads** page trades its warning for a
  terminal-`Myy` metric and a *Wing-attach reactions (LIMIT)* panel, and the
  **Export** page's Fuselage caption branches artifact/closed. The FAR 23 flight
  oracles are unaffected (no flight-loads or envelope calc changed).
  Full record: `docs/40_history/00_completed_development.md` and the design note
  `docs/40_history/04_m4-1_body_moment_closure.md`.


- **M4-17a — the landing-loads ↔ mass-model disconnection.**
  `weight_onecg.build_mass` had **zero production callers**: no page, no CLI path
  and no example ever produced `Project.mass`. The dashboard therefore showed
  Landing Loads "⛔ blocked — Needs: mass" on every shipped example while the
  landing results computed fine, and the One Engine Out gate was **unsatisfiable
  through the GUI**. The Weight & Mass Properties **Apply weight items** handler
  now persists `project.mass = build_mass(project)`, and the landing workflow
  step's `requires` drops `"mass"` — the LANDLOAD calc has read no mass slice
  since M2-8. `one_engine_out` still requires it (IZZ).
- **M4-17c — the landing CG seed could emit a zero waterline.** The seed read
  `project.mass.cases[0].cg_z`, always absent, and fell back to `0.0` against a
  ~60 in axle waterline — computing silently with nose-gear reactions of
  −233…−2887 lb (nonphysical) and braked-roll main loads 2.6× the p230 oracle.
  Missing-source cells are now **blank, never zero**; the page names the missing
  source and **blocks the reaction compute** until a real waterline is entered.
  Legacy project files carrying `zcg: 0` are blocked with an explanation rather
  than computed — an intentional, load-bearing behaviour change.
- **M4-17c — the forward CG limit is interpolated at the landing weight.** The
  seed paired the weight-agnostic outer-hull forward station (72.64 in) with the
  max-landing weight, where the manual reads the forward limit *at* that weight
  (76.12 in, Appendix A p230). New public
  `validation.wtenv_fwd_cg_limit_at_weight(project, weight_lb)` lerps the WTENV
  forward limit between the forward-regardless and forward-gross anchors,
  **clamped, never extrapolated**. Max-landing rows are also no longer seeded at
  full MTOW when the max landing weight is unset.
- **M4-17e — `_critical` excluded the side load.** The 23.485 family pick was a
  tie-break accident (cases 19–22 share an identical VMP); the ranking now uses
  the full √(V²+D²+S²) magnitude. Ranking only — no stored value changes, and the
  picks are unchanged on every bundled example.
- **M4-17b — seven stale `Project.mass` doc/help references** in
  `modules/landing.py`, `models/inputs.py` (four) and `app/views/landing_loads.py`
  (docstring + the gross-weight-override help), all of which contradicted the
  M2-8 removal note in the same files.

### Changed

- **The residual closure is three degrees of freedom, not two.** Plan 11 B-3
  specified `Δn` plus a pitch term. Nothing in an assembled model reacts **drag** —
  the suite has no distributed thrust — so leaving x open put 17–26 % of n·W into
  the support reaction and made "reactions ≈ 0" untrue in a deck that still
  solved. FAR 23's longitudinal load factor `nx` is exactly this quantity; on ga6
  PHAA the closure gives 0.661 g against the fixture's entered 0.6065. All three
  DOF are mutually decoupled, because the loading's centroid *is* the CG.

- **Imperial output gains two channels** (`csv/balance`, `txt/balance`) and
  `tests/fixtures_imperial/digests.json` was regenerated for exactly those. No
  existing channel moved — this step is additive, and the Appendix A oracles and
  every per-component deck are unchanged.


- **Schema v41.** `MassItem` gains `component`; `FuselageMassInput` gains
  `stations_are_override`. Both are optional and additive, but the *meaning* of
  `fuselage_mass.stations` changed — it is now an explicit override of the derived
  distribution rather than the sole input. Migration hop
  `_v40_fuselage_stations_override` therefore marks any pre-B1 file that already
  carries a station table as an override, so migrating a project **cannot silently
  move its fuselage loads**; the gap against the SSOT is reported instead
  (Fuselage Loads page), and adopting it stays the user's decision. Untagged mass
  items are deliberately *not* migrated to a guessed `component`.

- **Imperial output changed for the body channels** — `sbeam/body_cards`,
  `sbeam/body_span`, `sbeam/body_fitting` on all six examples, plus
  `csv/body_loads` and `txt/body_loads` newly present on `concept_heavy` — and
  `tests/fixtures_imperial/digests.json` was regenerated deliberately for exactly
  those. **This is an intended change**: the fuselage beam now carries the mass it
  should. Wing, tail and control decks, every other report/CSV channel and the
  case index are byte-identical, and the Appendix A oracle suites are unchanged
  (verified explicitly, plan 11 risk R2 — no oracle module reads `fuselage_mass`).


- **Imperial output changed for three deck channels** — `sbeam/body_cards`,
  `sbeam/tail_cards`, `sbeam/control_cards`, plus the `sbeam/tail_chordwise` CSV's
  `GID` column — and `tests/fixtures_imperial/digests.json` was regenerated
  deliberately for exactly those. **This is an intended change.** Wing decks,
  every report/CSV channel and the case index are byte-identical. The content
  changes are: the new `GRID` blocks; the h-tail/v-tail GID split below; the
  control deck's chord-fraction note; and two header lines re-wrapped to the
  72-column free-field width.

- **The h-tail and v-tail now take separate GID blocks** (`2001–2100` /
  `2101–2200`, via the new `sbeam_bridge.tail_station_gid`). They shared one
  `2001+` run, which was harmless only while the GIDs were bare references — the
  two components have different average chords, so their chord stations are
  *different points*, and one shared `GRID` block would have defined one node at
  two locations. **v-tail GIDs therefore shift** in both the tail deck and the
  tail chordwise CSV.

- **Schema v40 (F25-2).** `speeds` gains `vd_basis`, `mach_margin_min`,
  `mach_margin_basis` and `vb_kt`; `speeds.mach_limit.mc`/`.md` are **removed**.
  Migration hop `_v39_mach_limit_mc_md` drops the dead keys and `vd_basis`
  defaults to `speed_ratio`, so every pre-v40 project loads with exactly the
  numbers it had — pinned by a reduction-invariant test that compares VD/VC/VA/VF
  for all six shipped examples against values read off the pre-change build. An
  unrecognised `vd_basis` is refused at read rather than silently defaulted.

- **M4-2 — unified load-case identity + deck SUBCASE map (schema v39).** One
  case ID per physical condition, from the SELECT pick to the exported deck.
  - **Wing.** `select_wing`'s separate `W-40..49` band is retired: a wing
    condition's sequence now comes from its **name** (`case_ids.WING_SLOTS` —
    PHAA 1 … TORS 6), and `wing_inertia.wing_case_ref` returns SELECT's own
    `CaseRef` for the matching condition, so the WINGINER/NETLOADS distribution
    and the SELECT condition are one case with one id (they were two, with two
    independently-typed sets of Nz/Nx). **Wing case ids change** where a case's
    list position differed from its slot (ga6: TORS `W-02` → `W-06`, ACRL
    `W-03` → `W-05`).
  - **Vertical tail.** `one_engine_out` moves to its own `VT-30..` band. It
    previously minted `VT-01..` from a fresh allocator — the same ids
    `select_vtail` mints, for different physical cases.
  - **Wing cases derive from SELECT when none are entered**
    (`wing_inertia.resolve_wing_cases`), with a **Pull cases from SELECT** button
    on the Wing Loads page. An explicit list always wins, so no shipped example
    or oracle changes path.
  - **Decks.** `SUBCASE` and load-set `SID` are one integer derived from the case
    id (`case_ids.subcase_id`: `W-03` → 103), not the case's position — a
    filtered export can no longer renumber the subcases that survive. Every deck
    opens with a `$` subcase-map block naming the condition behind each number,
    the stick deck carries `LABEL = <case id>`, and the case-index CSV gained a
    `SUBCASE` column.
  - **Loading a project** now drops a `selected_case_ids` entry that matches no
    condition **with a warning** (it silently widened the governing-set export
    before). Re-pick the governing set on the Critical Loads page if warned.
  - The frozen Imperial baseline (`tests/fixtures_imperial/digests.json`) was
    **regenerated deliberately**: case ids, deck SIDs and the new index column
    move Imperial bytes. No load *value* changes.

- **Development-process overhaul (2026-08-05).** Documentation-only change set
  implementing the 2026-08-05 process review
  (`docs/50_reviews/2026-08-05_development_process_review.md`; findings F1–F7,
  recommendations R1–R11), which also assessed sloads against the sbeam 2026-08-04
  process changes. No code touched.
  - **Mission re-stated** in `CLAUDE.md` and the backlog: a *demonstrated* concept-loads
    → sbeam sizing loop, continuously verified in CI. **Backlog re-pointed**
    (`docs/30_future/00_backlog.md`): every item mission-tagged [E]/[V]; new
    mission-path items filed — the **sbeam round-trip CI harness**, the **global
    equilibrium invariant on exported decks**, the deck SUBCASE mapping (into M4-2),
    the load-axis/elastic-axis convention note, and the gust spanwise-distribution
    decision; ~20 off-mission items (M4-10b/11b, F25-3/5, the L long tail, the
    future-direction placeholders) moved with full write-ups to the new
    `docs/30_future/02_parked.md`; no new parallel ID series going forward. Stale
    D-refs and the `models.py` citation fixed in `01_concept_loads_plan.md`.
  - **Tiered S/M/L closure** replaces the uniform full-step-format rule in `CLAUDE.md`
    (small fixes: changelog + backlog + one-line history entry), plus five working
    rules: design-note-before-code, benchmark-first DoD (closure/invariant gates for
    concept mode with the same force as the oracle rule), **make-it-structural**
    (SSOT owner + drift-guard test on first need — the units/SI three-rebuild lesson),
    generalize-on-first-find, findings-filed-with-bodies. `CLAUDE.md` rewritten as
    rules + pointers (278 → ~160 lines) with named authoritative single sources.
  - **Review process tiered** (`CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` §0): light checklist for S,
    touched-area scoping for M, full process + design-note check for L; ~2-week/5-step
    review cadence; doc drift reclassified `[CRITICAL]` → `[MAJOR]`.
  - **Release cadence rule** (`RELEASE_PROCESS.md`): release every ~2–3 weeks or ~5
    steps behind a bounded gate; the unbounded docs-consistency audit dropped
    (enforced per-change instead). `[Unreleased]` is release-ripe — 0.4.0 due.
  - **Conventions charter added** (`docs/10_standard/CONVENTIONS.md`): axes/frames
    (+aft/+right/+up inches, identity map to sbeam CID 0), the two-channel unit sets,
    the LIMIT→ULTIMATE contract, case identity, preserved ENGLOADS signs — all
    code-verified with citations — plus the SSOT-owner/drift-guard table. Its
    extraction flagged four inconsistencies (chief: `load_keys.py` cites a
    **nonexistent** `tests/test_load_keys.py` as its uniqueness guard), filed on the
    backlog as an S-tier batch.
  - **Docs index** gains the `50_reviews/` section, the parked file and the charter;
    the resolved-decision count corrected (D-1…D-18). The history-file split (R11) is
    deferred to its own session (the file carries in-flight changes) and filed on the
    backlog.


- **The methods & limitations statement no longer cites backlog IDs.** It is now
  a report section as well as a CSV/BDF stamp, and `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §5 excludes
  internal development artifacts from a deliverable: the two affected limitations
  are stated in engineering terms and the tracking IDs stay in the repository.
  Wording only — no channel gains or loses a limitation, and the frozen Imperial
  baseline (which renders unstamped) is unchanged.

- **M4-20 step 7 — the Imperial baseline is frozen, and M4-20 is closed.**
  `tests/imperial_baseline.py` renders every deliverable channel of all six
  examples and freezes a SHA-256 each in `tests/fixtures_imperial/digests.json`
  (**256 channels**); the guard is decision D-21's guarantee that adding SI cost
  the Imperial user nothing, and its failure message names the drifted channel.
  Regenerate deliberately with `.venv/bin/python tests/imperial_baseline.py`.
  Joined by the bundle-single-system, per-dimension round-trip and end-to-end CLI
  tests, and by a source guard that no `sloads/modules/*.py` calls a conversion
  function — the calc is structurally outside this path, which is what leaves the
  Appendix A oracles untouched. M4-20 moved to
  `docs/40_history/00_completed_development.md`, D-19…D-22 to
  `03_resolved_decisions.md`, and **M3-3b G8.5 is unblocked**.

- **M4-20 step 6 — the GUI writes its downloads in the selected system.** The
  Export page resolves `components.active_system()` **once** into `_system` and
  passes it to all eleven artifact calls (five decks, five sbeam CSVs, the
  per-module load-case CSVs) plus the text report and workbook, and states the
  bundle's system in a caption built from `deliverable_units` itself — so the
  caption and the files cannot drift. The ten other views with download buttons
  (wing / fuselage / tail / control-surface / landing / weight / speeds /
  configuration) take their page's system too. `case_index_csv` deliberately takes
  none: its only dimensional columns are `Speed (kt)` and `Altitude (ft)`, the two
  aviation carve-outs.

- **M4-20 step 5 — every deliverable states its unit system in band.** The
  methods & limitations block (`report/methods.py`) takes `system=` and gains a
  `UNITS:` paragraph, so the one statement wrapped for every channel (G8-3) puts
  the unit set into every file: `# UNITS: …` in each CSV, `$ UNITS: …` in each
  BDF, the paragraph in `METHODS.txt` and the report. It is *bundle*-wide, not
  per-channel — the same block lands on both the human CSVs and the sbeam decks,
  so in SI it names both sets and attributes each (`N·m, kPa` for the readable
  files, `N·mm, MPa` for the decks); in Imperial one set does both jobs and the
  statement says so without inventing a split.
- **M4-20 step 5 — the BASIS `-ULT` marker list is derived, not hard-coded.** It
  listed `lbs-ULT, ft-lb-ULT, N-ULT, Nm-ULT` regardless of system: markers no
  Imperial file carries, and missing every marker step 4 added. It is now
  generated from both channels' unit sets, so it cannot fall out of step with what
  the writers emit.
- **M4-20 step 5 — `units_statement` names all four dimensions.** `Imperial (lb,
  in, lb-in, lb/in^2)` / `SI (N, mm, N·mm, MPa)`; pressure joined it because step
  4 found that dimension silently wrong, and kPa-vs-MPa is exactly what a reader
  cannot infer from the numbers.

- **M4-20 step 4 — the sbeam solver channel writes the consistent N/mm/N·mm set.**
  Every public `export/sbeam_bridge` writer (all 17: wing / body / tail /
  control-surface CSVs, the four `FORCE`/`MOMENT` card sets and the CBAR stick
  model, plus the `write_*` wrappers) takes `*, system=UnitSystem.IMPERIAL` and
  resolves it to `deliverable_units(system, Channel.SOLVER)`. In SI that is
  **N / mm / N·mm / MPa** — deliberately *not* the `N·m`/`kPa` a report uses,
  because a deck whose GRIDs are millimetres and whose forces are newtons is only
  correct when every derived unit is its base units combined (decision D-19).
  `cli.py --units si --export-sbeam` now works; the temporary refusal added in
  step 2 is gone.
- **M4-20 step 4 — `export/coordinates.py` is the enforced single scale point.**
  `to_grid` / `to_force` / `to_moment` and the new `to_pressure` take the unit set
  and apply its factor; **no arithmetic in `sbeam_bridge` scales anything.** CSV
  cell values go through the same three functions the cards do, so a span CSV and
  the deck it accompanies are the same numbers in the same units by construction.
  All four **raise** on a unit set that fails `is_consistent`: `deliverable_units(SI)`
  defaults to the *human* channel, so handing it to a deck writer is a plausible
  slip, and it now fails loudly instead of writing a 1000×-wrong torsion into a
  file that parses cleanly.
- **M4-20 step 4 — the solver unit set gained its own pressure (`MPa`), fixing a
  step-1 defect.** Step 1 gave the solver channel a consistent *moment* but left
  *pressure* at the human channel's `kPa` — the identical D-19 error one dimension
  over, since pressure is force / length². The solver set now carries `MPa`
  (N/mm²) from the **derived** `units.PSI_TO_MPA = LBF_TO_N / IN_TO_MM²`, and
  `DeliverableUnits.is_consistent` checks **both** derived dimensions
  (`moment == force × length` *and* `pressure == force / length²`), so the next one
  cannot be missed the same way.
- **M4-20 step 4 — every sbeam CSV header states its units.** The span-load,
  body, tail and control-surface CSV headers carry the unit and the `-ULT` marker
  on every dimensional column (`X (in)` → `X (mm)`, `Fz (lbs-ULT)` → `Fz (N-ULT)`,
  `My (lb-in-ULT)` → `My (Nmm-ULT)`), where they were previously bare (`X`, `Fz`,
  `My`) and a reader had to know from elsewhere that the file was Imperial. The
  BDF's axes and equilibrium comment lines take the active labels too. This is a
  visible **Imperial** change, which D-21 authorises; verified across all six
  examples × wing/tail/control × stick model, Imperial output changed by **zero
  numeric characters** — only header rows and two `$` comment lines. The
  fitting-load CSV's force marker moved from its own `lb-ULT` to the renderer's
  `lbs-ULT`, so the export channel and the report share one vocabulary.
- **M4-20 step 3 — the load-case CSV writer takes the unit system.**
  `io.load_cases_csv(results, header_comment="", *, system=UnitSystem.IMPERIAL)`
  and `io.write_load_cases_csv(..., system=...)` convert the whole table **once**,
  inside the writer, via `units.convert_results`. `report/render.py` is
  **unchanged**: it reads each `LoadValue.units` string, so an SI table's headers
  (`Vertical load (N-ULT)`, `Engine mount torque (Nm-ULT)`, `Loc X (mm)`) come out
  of the existing `_detect_unit` with no unit-system knowledge in the renderer at
  all, and `Speed (kt)` / `Altitude (ft)` stay byte-identical in both systems
  (the aviation carve-out). `system=IMPERIAL` is the identity — swept over every
  example × every module, the output is byte-identical to the call without the
  parameter, so no existing caller moves. `cli.py`'s `-o` path now hands the
  writer *unconverted* results plus the system; the two text reports still take
  pre-converted results plus their display label. A guard test pins
  `load_cases_csv` as the **only** `convert_results` caller in `io.py`, so the
  human export channel has exactly one conversion point and a caller cannot
  double-convert by pre-converting and passing `system=` as well.
- **M4-20 step 2 — the unit selection is now part of the project.**
  `Project.unit_system` (**`SCHEMA_VERSION` 37 → 38**) records which system every
  *deliverable* is rendered in. It is a **preference only** — `io.py` still never
  converts, so the values stored beside it are canonical Imperial as always, and
  a project written on an SI machine holds the same numbers as one written on an
  Imperial machine. Absent (every pre-v38 file) reads as Imperial, so an older
  project's output is unchanged. The field is **additive with a total default and
  therefore needs no migration hop**: absent *is* its documented value. Written to
  `project.json` only when non-default, on the v36 document-control precedent, so
  the six shipped examples gain no key at all.
- **M4-20 step 2 — `--units imperial|si` on the CLI**, with `cli.resolve_units`
  resolving flag → project preference → Imperial. A run with neither reproduces
  today's output exactly. `--units si --export-sbeam` **errors** rather than
  exporting: the sbeam writers are Imperial-only until step 4, and a deck written
  in units the user did not ask for is the exact failure this item exists to
  prevent.
- **M4-20 step 2 — the sidebar Imperial/SI toggle writes the project** (decision
  D-22), so changing units is a project edit and shows as an unsaved change.
  `app/components.active_system()` — the single read of the unit selection in the
  whole app layer (D-16) — was re-pointed at the field, and **no call site
  changed**: every view follows through `unit_number_input`/`page`, which is what
  that resolver was built for. `st.session_state["unit_system"]` survives only as
  the fallback for a render with no project yet.
- **M4-20 step 1 — deliverable unit sets (`units.py`).** `Channel`,
  `DeliverableUnits`, `deliverable_units(system, channel)` and `units_statement()`:
  the one authority for what units a deliverable is written in. Resolve it **once
  per bundle** and hand it to every writer, so two files in one export cannot
  disagree. Imperial is the all-1.0 identity set, so a writer needs no
  `if system == IMPERIAL` branch — "Imperial output is unchanged" becomes
  structural rather than a promise. Nothing consumes it yet; steps 2–7 wire it to
  the CSV/BDF/report writers. Plan:
  `docs/30_future/06_m4-20_deliverable_units_plan.md`.
- **The human/solver channel split (decision D-19).** Human-readable deliverables
  report moments in `N·m`; the sbeam decks and their companion span CSVs use
  **`N·mm`**, because sbeam is only correct in a dimensionally consistent set — a
  deck whose GRID coordinates are millimetres and whose forces are newtons needs
  `N·mm` moments, and an `N·m` one is wrong by 1000× in a file that parses
  cleanly and sizes structure. Moment factors are now *derived* as force × length
  from named base constants, and a test asserts `moment == force × length` for
  the solver set in both systems.


- **`PROJECT_GUIDE.md`'s schema-change convention contradicted the tripwire.** It
  said a new optional field with a default "needs nothing", while
  `test_schema_guards.py`'s fields-hash tripwire fails on *any* persisted-shape
  change — as it duly did for `unit_system`. The convention now states the
  additive case explicitly: bump `SCHEMA_VERSION`, write no hop.
- **`Pa-ULT` → `kPa-ULT` (decision D-20).** `units.py` already converted psi → kPa
  everywhere in the GUI while three documents specified `Pa`. The code was right;
  CLAUDE.md, `00_program_overview.md` and `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §3.5 now say
  `kPa-ULT`, keeping one pressure unit across GUI and exports. `SUMMARY_REPORT.md`
  §3.5 also gains the solver-deck carve-out its "no dual display" clause would
  otherwise have forbidden.

- **Backlog review — M4 re-prioritised and the future-development tree pruned
  (docs only).** **M4-20** (deliverables render in the user-selected unit
  system) is now the first M4 item: **M3-3b** (the G8 report document) was
  listed first while being explicitly blocked on it, so the head of the list
  could not actually be worked. M3-3b follows, with its one unit-independent
  sub-step (`content.py`) called out as startable in parallel. The backlog's
  shipped-work narrative is replaced by pointers to `40_history/`, **M4-23**
  gained a full entry (it was previously only a line in the defect index), and
  the ~25-nit **L-8** bucket is split into **L-8a…L-8f** (SI-toggle conformance,
  tooltip rollout, results/export parity, widget freshness, uncovered fields,
  and a clearly-marked display-only tail) so the items can close independently.
- **Three spent plan documents moved from `docs/30_future/` to
  `docs/40_history/`**, so `30_future/` holds only live plans:
  `02_gui_workflow_plan.md` → `40_history/05_phase_d_gui_workflow_plan.md`
  (Phase D, executed; nav grouping superseded by Phase G), `04_m3-1_rename_procedure.md`
  → `40_history/06_m3-1_rename_procedure.md` (executed with 0.3.0), and
  `06_m4_maintainability_sequence_plan.md` →
  `40_history/07_m4_maintainability_sequence_plan.md` (all six steps shipped
  2026-08-03/04). Each carries an "executed and closed" banner; all inbound
  links across `docs/`, `sloads/`, `tests/` and this changelog were repointed,
  and every markdown link target under `docs/` was verified to resolve.

- **M4-9 — a result's meaning is now its `key`, not its display label.**
  `LoadValue` gains a stable snake_case `key`; `report`, `export`, the views and
  the tests match on it and nothing branches on `label` any more. Rewording a
  column heading used to make the lookup return `None`, which `_val` turned into
  `""` — the CSV shipped with a blank cell and no error anywhere. All **327**
  producing sites across 21 modules are keyed, the cross-module keys live in the
  new `sloads/load_keys.py`, and the 23.371(b) gyro sub-cases come off the key
  instead of a regex over the label. **No output changed**: a snapshot of every
  value, every rendered row and every text report across all six examples is
  byte-identical before and after. `SCHEMA_VERSION` 36 → 37.
- **M4-9 — six calc-side modules stopped reading another module's labels.**
  `validation`, `structural_speeds`, `landing`, `weight_envelope`,
  `weight_estimate` and `flight_envelope.design_inputs` looked up `"Total area"`,
  `"MAC"`, `"XBAR (fus station)"` and the design speeds by label across a module
  boundary. `configuration.cg_estimate` no longer takes a dict at all: it indexed
  `geom["MAC"]`, and the Configuration page was passing it the *LoadValue* table
  rather than the geometry dict — which worked only because the two happened to
  spell `"MAC"` the same way.
- **M4-10 — `project.json` loading is now a migration chain, not key sniffing.**
  `io.project_from_dict` decided what it was reading with a 19-clause `or` gate
  enumerating every slice name, and handled each legacy file shape with an inline
  shim threaded through the readers. Both are gone. `sloads/migrations.py` holds a
  chain of pure `dict -> dict` hops — one per version that changed the file's
  *shape*, with the archaeology of which legacy path belongs to which version
  finally written down — and `io.py` reads the current schema only.
  **All five legacy shims deleted**, the three `legacy_*` reader parameters
  removed, `io.py` down from 1,290 to 1,180 lines. The project/engine
  discriminator now derives its key set from `Project`'s own dataclass fields, so
  adding a slice can no longer silently downgrade a real project to an
  engine-only read. All six examples round-trip byte-identically; six frozen
  fixtures (v0 bare engine, v18, v24, v26, v28, v36) pin every reachable
  historical shape. *(M4-9 later renamed the v36 fixture and added a v37 one, so
  the set is seven.)*
- **M4-10 — legacy migrations are version-gated.** The old shims ran on *every*
  file regardless of version, which meant a current project that legitimately had
  no `weight.cg_cases` had them invented from `flight_loads`, and one with no
  `aero_coeffs` had a set resurrected from a stale
  `flight_loads.configurations`. The hops run only for files old enough to need
  them. Two tests that claimed to cover "pre-schema-18/19 files" were in fact
  mutating a current dict and passing for the wrong reason; they now declare the
  version they test.


- **G8.1 — `sloads/report.py` is now the `sloads/report/` package**, the same
  mechanical move `models.py` → `models/` made at M3-1. Existing code is
  `report/render.py` verbatim and every public name is re-exported, so all 15
  importing modules are unchanged. One exception surfaced by the move:
  `report._fmt` was imported across the module boundary by a test, so it is
  promoted to **`report.format_value`** per the M4-12b public-symbol contract.


- **M4-12b — public import contract: seven private symbols promoted, `__all__`
  on the four defining modules.** `app/` no longer imports any underscored name
  from `sloads` — the two live violations
  (`configuration_layout` → `wing_geometry._interp_x`, `components` →
  `structural_speeds._maneuver_load_factors`) are gone, along with five
  cross-module private imports inside `sloads/`. Promotions (66 sites):
  `interp_x`, `maneuver_load_factors`, `design_inputs`, `density_ratio`,
  `elevator_load`, `flaps_by_config_name`, `default_envelope`. Names outside a
  module's `__all__` are module-private, and there is deliberately no
  `sloads/api.py` facade. **No behaviour change:** a full result snapshot — every
  module, condition, `LoadValue` and safety factor across all 6 examples — is
  byte-identical before and after, and every Appendix A figure and tolerance
  literal is unedited.
- **M4-12b — `select.htail_balance` returns a typed `HtailBalance`.** The
  rational tail balance crossed three module boundaries as a `Dict[str, float]`
  whose string keys were the API; it is now a `NamedTuple` with lowercase
  attributes (`lt25`, `lt50`, `at`, `delta`, `lt`, `cp`) and the Ref 1 Ch 9
  symbols tabulated in its docstring. BALLOADS' `verify_balancing` row dicts are
  a separate structure and keep their keys.
- **M4-12b — porting contract extended** (`PROJECT_GUIDE.md` §5):
  `sync_geometry_derived(project)` is called first inside `run()` (seven sites,
  previously convention-by-imitation); cross-module results are typed, not
  stringly-keyed; the public surface is explicit; and no new property proxies on
  `Project`. The `Project.tail_loads`/`.vtail_loads` trap-doors — invisible to
  `dataclasses.fields`/`asdict`/`replace`, and a setter that silently no-ops on
  `None` — are now documented beside the properties, with retirement assigned to
  **M4-10**.

- **M4-12a — test architecture: shared helpers and form-key button selection.**
  Nine near-identical `_value` lookups (three different signatures) collapse into
  `tests/helpers.py` — `value_of` / `load_value` / `values_by_label`, each
  accepting a `ModuleResult`, a `ConditionResult` or a nested list of either.
  Shared input builders move to `tests/fixtures.py` and the sbeam free-field BDF
  reader to `helpers.parse_cards`, so **no test module imports another test
  module** (eight did). The helper signature is deliberately the one **M4-9**
  will re-point at `LoadValue.key`, which is why the consolidation lands first.
  Tests-only: no `sloads/` or `app/` change; 536 tests pass with every numeric
  assertion unedited.


- **BREAKING (sbeam body decks): fuselage GIDs are now keyed off station
  provenance, not table index.** The carry-through reaction inserts nodes into
  the *middle* of the beam, so the old `1001 + i` numbering would have silently
  renumbered every mass station aft of the wing whenever a spar fraction moved.
  `BodyStationLoad.source` (`mass`/`tail`/`carry`/`correction`) now drives
  `sbeam_bridge.body_station_gids`: mass + tail stations keep `1001 +` in
  nose→tail order, reaction nodes take a disjoint `1501 +` block (each block
  holds 500; the tail family still starts at 2001, and the function raises
  rather than collide). **Body decks exported before this release must be
  re-exported** — `fuselage_loads.bdf` and `fuselage_span_loads.csv` GIDs no
  longer match a previously issued deck. Wing, tail and control-surface GIDs are
  unchanged.
- **The Configuration & Layout page takes the wing spar fractions.** Optional
  front/rear `% chord` inputs per surface; **left blank they stay `None`**,
  which is what makes the entered-vs-assumed provenance reachable from the GUI —
  before this every project necessarily resolved as `assumed`.

- **Backlog hygiene sweep** (docs only, no open work dropped).
  `docs/30_future/00_backlog.md` 570 → 469 lines: removed the completed-M3
  section, the shipped-item recitals and the 2026-07-21/07-23 review narratives
  (all recorded in history), dropped the stale gate snapshots in favour of CI,
  and stripped the superseded "(was 2-x)" legacy IDs. The resolved
  design-decision table D-1…D-11 moved to the new register
  `docs/40_history/03_resolved_decisions.md` (open **D-5** stays in the
  backlog); M4-1's diagnosis, A–E options trade and formulas moved to the new
  `06_m4-1_body_moment_closure.md` (now closed and filed as
  `docs/40_history/04_m4-1_body_moment_closure.md`), leaving the decided approach
  and acceptance criteria in the backlog. Both new docs are indexed in
  `docs/00_INDEX.md`.
- **Backlog ID collision fixed.** `M4-18` was in use by two different items —
  the shipped loads-reference-axis step (history, `CHANGELOG`, `GUI_design.md`
  v34, `PROGRAM_SPEC.md`, `project.py`) and the open fuselage pitching
  load-factor item. The open item is renumbered **M4-21**; the shipped step
  keeps M4-18 everywhere it is already cited.

- **Standard: deliverable units follow the user's selection** (docs only; the
  code change is backlog **M4-20**). Exports are no longer fixed to the calc's
  Imperial units — the report, the load-case CSV, the span-load CSVs and the sbeam
  `FORCE`/`MOMENT` cards all render in the system the user chose (GUI toggle,
  persisted in the project, overridable headless by `--units imperial|si`,
  default Imperial), one system per bundle, each file stating its system in-band.
  The `-ULT` marker converts with the unit (`N-ULT`, `Nm-ULT`, `Pa-ULT`); no dual
  display; airspeed (KEAS) and altitude (ft) remain aviation-standard and
  unconverted in both systems. Calc and the stored `project.json` values stay
  canonical Imperial, so the Appendix A/B oracles are unaffected. Updated
  `docs/10_standard/SUMMARY_REPORT.md` §2/§3.5/§4.1/§4.7/§6,
  `00_program_overview.md`, `GUI_design.md` §4/§7/§10, `PROJECT_GUIDE.md`,
  `CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` (checklist + finding table),
  `docs/30_future/01_concept_loads_plan.md` and
  `05_step_g8_summary_report_plan.md` §10.1 (open question resolved).


- Landing CG-case rows are **name-locked and order-canonical**: the data editor's
  `Loading` column is read-only and Apply writes the canonical names, while
  `landing._cg_cases` reorders by name when all three canonical names are present
  (otherwise positional, exactly as before). The editor could previously be
  renamed or reordered into a silent mis-assignment of the braked-roll/side
  weight groups, which are indexed positionally.
- Every bundled `examples/*.project.json` now carries a regenerated `mass` block.
  Consequence: `configuration.cg_estimate` flips from the 25%-MAC fallback to its
  "Weight DB" branch, so the tip-back / overturn / CG-station figures change on
  five examples (e.g. GA-6 CG 74.07 → 85.0 in, tip-back 33.11 → 13.49°, overturn
  43.01 → 48.69°). `one_engine_out` on the twin turboprops now passes the mass
  gate and stops at the next missing input (engine horsepower) instead.
- Removed the never-assigned, never-read `nv`/`nd`/`nns` fields from
  `GearReactionCase`. The airplane-datum `vm`/`dm`/`vn`/`dn` are kept (they *are*
  computed) and documented as an M4-6 hook.
- **`SCHEMA_VERSION` is unchanged (33):** the `mass` block already round-tripped
  through `io.mass_from_dict`/`mass_to_dict` and is optional on read. Only its
  *presence* changes, not the schema shape.
- **`report._LOAD_CASE_LABELS` is deliberately not extended.** A LANDLOAD case is
  a *pair* of reactions at two stations with three unbalanced moments;
  `load_cases_to_rows`' single-point-load schema cannot hold that without losing
  the nose reaction or fabricating locations, so landing keeps routing through
  `results_to_rows` (locked by a test).
- **No calc-math change.** The Appendix-A landing oracles (p230 K/GAMMA/BETA and
  the lever-arm table; p236 V/N/NLG) and all existing tests pass unchanged; the
  p230 oracles are additionally re-asserted through the full
  `build_landing(load_project(...))` pipeline as a regression guard.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-23

**Concept-loads v1** — the suite becomes an initial-concept distributed-loads
tool: the `concept` category (caps beyond FAR 23), fleet comparison, per-component
distributed loads (wing/body/tail + simplified control surfaces) and the sbeam
`FORCE`/`MOMENT` export, on top of the oracle-locked FAR 23 replication core.
This release also **renames the suite `farloads` → `sloads`** (decision D-6/D-11;
package, CLI entry point and docs), completes GUI Phase G (workflow navigation,
six-phase analysis flow, per-page unit boundary), and lands the per-case
safety-factor chain end-to-end (M4-7, M4-13 … M4-16): every deliverable is
ULTIMATE with its case's `SF` stated, LIMIT analysis artifacts are basis-marked
in-band, and a corrupt persisted factor can neither crash nor under-scale an
export. Suite at cut: 501 tests, ~93% coverage, ruff clean, smoke test PASS,
`SCHEMA_VERSION = 33`.

### Added

- **`SF` column on the four sbeam span/chordwise CSVs** (wing, fuselage, tail
  chordwise, control surface) — the case's limit→ultimate factor, satisfying
  "every load case SHALL state its safety factor". Appended as the **last**
  column, so positional parsers are unaffected (`Case,GID,X,Fz,Sz,Myy` →
  `Case,GID,X,Fz,Sz,Myy,SF`).

- **Trim & static-margin plots — Flight Envelope page (Phase G, Step G5).** A new
  **Trim & Stability** tab on the Flight Envelope page plots the balancing
  horizontal-tail load at 1-g trim (FLTLOADS BAL A/C/D) swept across the CG range,
  and the tail-volume static margin. A pure `flight_envelope.trim_sweep()` helper
  re-runs the existing FLTLOADS balance (subroutine 3900) at ~15 interpolated CG
  stations at a fixed weight/waterline — no new load equations, so a swept station
  that coincides with a project CG case reproduces that case's `build_envelope` BAL
  load exactly. The static-margin sweep reads the tail-volume **neutral point** from
  the Configuration module (`SM = NP − CG`, %MAC) and overlays the WTENV
  forward/aft CG limits; it is shown only when the project carries a parametric
  layout (Appendix A/B fixtures show just the trim plot). Tail loads on the tab are
  **LIMIT** (marked, with the ULTIMATE deliverables pointed to on the Critical
  Loads tab / Results Review / exports). GUI-only over existing calc — no schema
  change. (Config-building for the balance was factored into
  `flight_envelope._balance_configs`, shared by `build_envelope` and `trim_sweep`
  so both see the same G4 fuselage-augmented coefficients; behaviour unchanged.)
- **Fuselage pitching-moment estimator — Munk slender-body (Phase G, Step G4).** A
  pure, geometry-only helper (`farloads/fuselage_moment.py`) derives the fuselage's
  contribution to the airplane-less-tail moment slope `dCm/dα` from the G1 fuselage
  outline (Munk apparent-mass method, NACA TR-184 / DATCOM 4.2.1.1; see
  `reference/fuselage_pitching_moment.md`), so a concept airplane built from a
  planform no longer has to hand-fold the fuselage into the FLTLOADS input
  coefficients. Surfaced on the **Aerodynamic Data** page: the estimate (volume,
  fineness ratio, `k₂−k₁`, ΔM1) is displayed and overridable, with an enable
  checkbox. A new `AeroCoefficientsInput.fuselage_moment` field
  (`FuselageMomentInput{enabled, d_cm_dalpha}`) carries it; when enabled,
  `flight_envelope.build_envelope` adds ΔM1 to every configuration's M1 (a local
  copy — the stored raw coefficients are untouched) and the compressibility factor
  applies automatically. **Off by default → Appendix A/B oracles bit-for-bit
  unchanged** (their coefficients already include the fuselage). `SCHEMA_VERSION`
  25 → 26; older files load with no fuselage moment.

- **Concept engine gyroscopic guard + warn (Phase 1, Step P1-5).** The optional
  FAR 25.371 gyroscopic concept case (`engine.condition_25_371`) uses a fixed
  FAR 23.371(b) stand-in (2.5 rad/s yaw, 1 rad/s pitch); the gyro moment is linear
  in body rate, so the stand-in under-predicts for a concept whose real rates are
  higher. `EngineInput` gains two optional advisory fields —
  `design_yaw_rate_rad_s` / `design_pitch_rate_rad_s` (**`SCHEMA_VERSION` 22 → 23**,
  additive; older files load with both unset) — and when a declared rate exceeds its
  stand-in the case's note becomes an explicit `WARNING -- gyroscopic loads
  UNDER-PREDICTED …` (naming the axis, rate and moment ratio). Per decision D-2 this
  is **warn-only**: the reported moment stays at the fixed stand-in (the declared
  rates are advisory, not a re-derivation). The engine GUI page adds the two rate
  inputs and renders `WARNING` notes as `st.warning`. The GA/oracle path is
  unchanged (no declared rates → no warning). Guarded by five new tests in
  `tests/test_engine_far25.py`.

- **Complete export package public API (Phase 1, Step P1-4).**
  `farloads/export/__init__.py` now re-exports all four component families +
  the case index: the body (`body_span_load_csv`, `body_force_moment_cards`),
  control-surface (`control_surface_csv`/`control_surface_force_moment_cards` +
  their `write_*` variants), and case-index (`case_index_csv`,
  `write_case_index_csv`, `filter_by_selected_case_ids`) functions were previously
  reachable only via the `sbeam_bridge` submodule (`__all__` advertised wing + tail
  only). The package docstring is rewritten from "wing-only" to enumerate all four
  families. Guarded by `test_sbeam_bridge.py::test_export_package_exposes_all_component_families`.
  API-surface-only (no calc-math or schema change).

- **Concept↔FAR23 identity test (Phase 1, Step P1-3).** `tests/test_concept.py`
  now guards the C-1 invariant ("concept mode reduces **exactly** to FAR23 on GA
  inputs") *directly, through the concept branch* — previously it was only assumed
  via the absence of GA-oracle regression. `test_concept_reduces_to_far23_on_ga_inputs`
  runs `ga6_normal` through `run_all_modules` twice — once as Normal (`category="N"`)
  and once flipped to concept (`category="C"`) with the FAR23-computed load factors
  (n = 3.8, nneg = −1.52 per 14 CFR 23.337, derived from the baseline) — and asserts
  full-pipeline parity (every module's every `LoadValue` matches at `rel_tol=1e-3`;
  only the appended concept `note` may differ). `test_concept_load_factors_match_far23_caps`
  pins the single numeric divergence point (`structural_speeds._maneuver_load_factors`).
  Test-only (no calc-math or schema change); FAR23 oracles unmoved.

- **Concept distributed-loads closure suite (Phase 1, Step P1-2).**
  `tests/test_concept_closure.py` (10 tests) drives `net_loads`, `body_loads`,
  `taildist`, `aileron`/`flap`/`tab` through the P1-1 concept fixture
  (`concept_regional_jet`) and asserts **physics-closure per component** — concept
  mode's only validation above the 12,500 lb FAR23 oracle band. Checks: wing lift
  closes vertically (`LZW + LT = Nz·W`); the balancing tail load reacts the pitching
  moment about the CG (`LT·(Xt−Xcg) = LZW·(Xcg−Xw) − DX·(Zcg−Zw) + M(W+F)`); the
  fuselage net distribution is free-free (terminal cumulative shear = 0); TAILDIST
  carries SELECT's `lt25`/`lt50` split verbatim; each control surface's `build_*`
  load matches its `run` analysis report; and every component family's nodal FORCE
  set (and its re-parsed cards) sums to that component's root/total at ULTIMATE —
  the whole concept airframe exports cleanly through `sbeam_bridge`. Test-only
  (no calc-math or schema change); FAR23 oracles unmoved.

- **Full-airframe concept reference fixture (Phase 1, Step P1-1).**
  `examples/concept_regional_jet.project.json` — "RJ-50 concept", a swept-wing,
  high-subsonic twin-turbofan regional jet (MTOW 33,000 lb, S 500 ft², c/4 sweep
  24°, cruise M 0.74, 50 seats; `category="C"`, Part 25 load factors, `include_far25`).
  It is the first concept example to drive **every** component path — the wing chain,
  `body_loads`, `taildist`, `aileron`/`flap`/`tab`, and the swept `AIRLOAD4` branch
  (19 modules, no missing-slice skips) — where `concept_heavy` reached the wing only.
  Carries the two slices no GA fixture had (`fuselage_mass`, `configuration`); the
  turbofan is modelled with a fan-spool `Rotor` and no propeller (25.371 gyro path).
  Guarded by `tests/test_concept_regional_jet.py`. Airplane per decision D-1, engine
  per D-2.

- **Aircraft Comparison page (Phase F, Step F2).** A dedicated
  `app/views/aircraft_comparison.py` view in the **Export** phase (before Results
  Review; GUI-only `WorkflowStep`) is now the single home for the fleet comparison.
  It carries a quantitative readout (nearest-3, W/S & W/P percentile band, outliers),
  a **parameter table** (subject + nearest-N over MTOW/OEW/power/W-S/W-P/wingspan/
  area/AR/seats), and **six scatter tabs** (W/S-vs-W/P, MTOW-vs-OEW, and wingspan /
  wing area / aspect ratio / seats vs. MTOW). `Subject` (and `FleetPoint`) gain
  presentation-only `wingspan_ft`/`aspect_ratio`/`seats` fields plus `span` /
  `aspect_ratio_effective` derivations (`span = √(AR·S)`); the nearest-N distance
  stays on MTOW / W/S / W/P, so `fleet_stats` is byte-identical (decision D-F2-a).
  Guarded by new `tests/test_aircraft_comparison.py` and extended
  `tests/test_fleet_compare.py`. No calc-math or oracle change.

- **Reference-fleet expansion for the Aircraft Comparison page (Phase F, Step
  F1).** `app/data/reference_aircraft.csv` gains an `aspect_ratio` column (span²/area)
  and six aircraft (PA-28-181 Archer, Cirrus SR22, Diamond DA40, Extra 300, PA-44
  Seminole, TBM 940 — 23 → 29) to broaden the geometric spread. `FleetPoint` carries
  optional `seats` / `wingspan_ft` / `aspect_ratio` (defaults; `fleet_stats`
  unaffected), and `_fleet_points` maps them. Data-only; no calc-math or oracle
  change. Guarded by `tests/test_reference_aircraft.py`.

- **`farloads.constants.convert_airspeed` + `eas_to_mach`/`mach_to_eas` (Phase E,
  Step E7).** Presentation-layer airspeed conversions: KEAS→KTAS (=KEAS/√σ) and
  KEAS→KCAS (standard subsonic compressible impact-pressure relation, exact at sea
  level). Backed by `tests/test_airspeed_conversions.py`.

- **Quantitative fleet comparison (Phase E, Step E4).** The visual, duplicated
  fleet scatters on **Configuration & Layout** and **Weight Estimate** are unified
  behind one shared helper that adds a **quantitative readout** above the scatters:
  the **nearest-3** similar reference aircraft (by a normalized distance over
  log-MTOW plus W/S and W/P where known), the **W/S and W/P percentile band**, and
  **outlier flags** (outside the fleet p10–p90). The numeric core is the new pure,
  unit-tested `farloads/fleet.py` (`fleet_stats(subject, fleet) -> FleetStats`; no
  pandas / file access / Streamlit); the CSV load and rendering are the single
  `app/components.render_fleet_comparison`, reused by both pages. Jets (`max_hp = 0`)
  are excluded from the W/P comparison only, never from the comparator pool.
  GUI-only: no schema change (`SCHEMA_VERSION` stays **22**) and no calc-math change
  — the Appendix A/B oracles are untouched (343 tests pass, +10). Implements
  `GUI_design.md §8.4`.
- **Graphical review + input-consistency validation (Phase E, Step E3).** Two new
  pure, unit-tested helpers and their GUI surfacing. `farloads/vn_diagram.py` builds
  a proper **V-n diagram** — the curved stall boundary `n = (V/VS)²`, the flaps-up
  and flaps-down (n ≤ 2.0, 14 CFR 23.337(b)) manoeuvre envelopes and the gust lines
  at VC/VD (textbook Pratt form, 14 CFR 23.341) — now shown on the **Structural
  Speeds** page (Flaps up/down/both + gust toggle, LIMIT-marked; the rigorous
  Mach-corrected gust V-n stays on the Flight Envelope page, unchanged).
  `farloads/validation.py` adds `consistency_warnings(project)` — taper > 1,
  non-positive area, LE/TE ordering, Configuration-vs-WINGGEOM wing-area mismatch,
  and CG outside the WTENV structural envelope — surfaced as `st.warning` on the
  relevant definition pages. The **Weight/CG/Inertia** page gains a CG-marker +
  mass-distribution plot (with the WTENV limits when defined). GUI-only in effect:
  no schema change (`SCHEMA_VERSION` stays **22**) and no calc-math change — the
  Appendix A/B oracles are untouched (333 tests pass, +18). Implements
  `GUI_design.md §8.2/§8.3`.
- **Parameter explanation — tooltips + guides (Phase E, Step E2).** Every domain
  input widget across the six Airplane-definition pages (Configuration & Layout,
  Wing / Surface Geometry, Weight Estimate, Weight/CG/Inertia, Structural Speeds,
  Aerodynamic Data) now carries a `help=` hover tooltip citing the relevant FAR
  paragraph and Reference-1 program/chapter; the three grid (`st.data_editor`)
  pages and the dense pages additionally carry a collapsible **"ℹ️ Parameter
  guide"** expander defining the jargon (MAC, XLEMAC, static margin, neutral
  point, tip-back/overturn, shoulder altitude, KEAS, the aero `C0…C4`
  polynomials, per-item inertias and the parallel-axis convention). GUI-only:
  no schema change (`SCHEMA_VERSION` stays **22**) and no calc-math change — the
  Appendix A/B oracles are untouched (314 tests pass). Implements
  `GUI_design.md §8.1`.
- **FAR 23 applicability detection + occupants/crew fields (Phase E, Step E1).** The
  GUI now surfaces — never blocks — when an airplane exceeds the FAR 23 applicability
  band. New pure, unit-tested `farloads.far23_applicability(project)` returns the
  structured exceedances (field / value / limit / label) against the non-commuter
  FAR 23 tier (12,500 lb / 9 passenger seats, the required flight crew excluded);
  the limits live once in `farloads/constants.py` (`FAR23_MAX_WEIGHT_LB` etc.,
  `DEFAULT_FLIGHT_CREW = 1`, with the 19,000 lb / 19-seat commuter tier encoded but
  dormant until a distinct Commuter category exists). Two additive schema fields
  (`SCHEMA_VERSION` **20 → 22**, older files load with defaults): a
  `StructuralSpeedsInput.occupants` field (total souls; falls back to the Weight
  Estimate seat count) entered on **Structural Speeds** and echoed read-only on
  **Configuration & Layout**; and a `WeightEstimationInput.crew` field (flight crew,
  default 1) entered on **Weight Estimate**, subtracted from occupants for the seat
  check (`passenger seats = occupants − crew`) and carried in a new derived
  **operating empty weight** line WTESTIMA reports (`OEW = empty + crew×170`, a
  reporting-only figure — `MTOW`/`useful`/`empty` and their Appendix-A oracles are
  untouched). A shared `app/components.render_applicability_banner` renders a
  non-blocking banner on the **Dashboard** and the definition pages with a one-click
  **"Switch to Concept"** action that flips `speeds.category = "C"` and seeds
  `chosen_n`/`chosen_nneg` from the computed FAR 23.337 factors so the switch is
  continuous. No calc-math change — the Appendix A/B oracles pass unmodified and
  concept mode still reduces exactly to FAR 23 on GA inputs. Tests:
  `tests/test_applicability.py` (GA → no exceedances; 20,000 lb / 12-occupant Normal
  → weight + seat exceedances; crew reduces the seat count), the OEW line in
  `tests/test_weight_estimate.py`, and occupants/crew io round-trip / old-file
  defaults in `tests/test_io.py`.

- **Definition pages seed defaults from upstream project data.** Pages no longer
  re-ask for a quantity another slice already owns. New
  `farloads.modules.configuration.wing_layout_from_surface()` (the inverse of
  `wing_polylines`) lets **Configuration & Layout** seed its parametric wing
  fields (area / aspect ratio / taper / LE sweep / LE station) from an existing
  WINGGEOM `wing` surface; **Flight Envelope** seeds MAC / wing area / 25%-MAC
  station from that surface (and waterline from `configuration`) instead of
  hardcoded Appendix-A literals; **Mach Limit** seeds `MC`/`MD`/shoulder
  altitude from STRSPEED's `design_speed_values`; **Tail Loads** seeds the
  h/v-tail spans from `configuration.h_tail_span_ft`/`v_tail_span_ft`; **Wing
  Loads** seeds dihedral from `configuration.dihedral_deg`. Each seed fires only
  when the page's own field is still unset, so an explicit value is never
  overwritten. No calc-math change, no new `Project` slice, `SCHEMA_VERSION`
  unchanged at 20.

- **Airplane-phase GUI usability pass: tail geometry, wing planform plot,
  aero-data naming.** `LayoutInput` gains `tail_type` (`TailType`:
  `CONVENTIONAL`/`T_TAIL`/`V_TAIL`/`CRUCIFORM`, additive, default
  `CONVENTIONAL`) plus `h_tail_span_ft`/`h_tail_z`/`v_tail_span_ft` (all
  default `0.0`, backward-compatible — an older project with these unset draws
  no tail, exactly as before). New `farloads.modules.configuration.
  tail_planform()` sketches the tail panel(s) for the Configuration & Layout
  three-view, which now draws them in Top/Side/Front alongside the existing
  wing/fuselage/gear overlays. The Wing/Surface Geometry page gains a top-view
  planform plot (new shared `farloads.modules.wing_geometry.
  surface_top_outline()` helper, also used by the three-view's wing outline).
  The `aero_coefficients` Airplane-phase step is retitled "Aerodynamic Data"
  (key unchanged) with a cross-link caption to the Wing Loads page, where the
  per-surface spanwise (Schrenk) aero input stays, with a matching caption
  pointing back. `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped 19 → 20 (additive fields only).

- **Session-wide Imperial/SI display toggle + Project JSON Editor page.** A
  single sidebar control (`app/Home.py`, `st.session_state["unit_system"]`)
  now drives Imperial/SI display consistently across every GUI page (all 24
  views), replacing the handful of pages that previously had their own local,
  uncoordinated toggle. New `farloads.units` scalar helpers (`to_si_scalar`,
  `si_scalar_label`) convert per-station/per-case dataclass values (wing/
  fuselage/tail/landing-gear results) that aren't `ConditionResult`/`LoadValue`
  based; every conversion is display-only — the objects feeding sbeam BDF
  export, project persistence and CSV downloads stay canonical Imperial.
  Airspeed (KEAS) and altitude (ft) are never converted (aviation-standard
  units in both systems). New `app/views/project_editor.py` (Start section):
  the whole project shown/hand-editable as JSON in the selected units, backed
  by new `farloads.units.project_dict_to_display`/`project_dict_to_imperial`
  (a field-name-driven whole-project converter, distinct from mass-vs-force
  `_lb` fields); Apply converts back to Imperial before updating the session.
  `project.json` on disk is unchanged — still Imperial-only, no unit tag ever
  written, no new `Project` slice, `SCHEMA_VERSION` unchanged at 19.

- **Export & report upgrades** (Phase D Step D8 — closes Phase D). Export page
  gains a "📊 Download workbook (.xlsx)" button (new `farloads/export
  /workbook.py::build_workbook`, `openpyxl` dependency): one workbook tab per
  module/component (Project info, per-module load-case CSVs, the case-index
  table, and the tabular sbeam span-load CSVs), a sibling alternative to the
  `.zip` bundle. Export page also gains an "Export scope" toggle (Full set /
  Governing set) that filters the fuselage/tail sbeam artifacts and the case
  index to the D5 Critical Loads page's selection (new pure helper
  `sbeam_bridge.filter_by_selected_case_ids`); wing and control-surface
  exports always include the full set since their case ids don't overlap
  `envelope.critical`'s (a known, documented gap — see the backlog). No
  calc-math change, no new `Project` slice, `SCHEMA_VERSION` unchanged at 19.

- **Loads Plots page** (Phase D Step D7). New `app/views/loads_plots.py`, the
  sixth workflow section: a read-only, consolidated viewer over the
  distributed-load results already persisted on `Project.loads` by the
  Analysis pages — a component picker (wing / fuselage / horizontal tail /
  vertical tail / aileron / flap / tab), overlay plots by case ID with a
  max-|value| envelope trace, a combined wing+fuselage "total loads" snapshot,
  and an external-comparison CSV importer reusing
  `farloads.export.sbeam_bridge.span_load_csv`/`body_span_load_csv`'s exact
  column schema. `farloads/workflow.py` gains the `loads_plots` step
  (`module=None`, like `dashboard`/`results_review`/`export_report`), which
  makes "5 · Loads Plots" appear in `Home.py`'s sidebar automatically. Pure
  GUI addition — no calc-math change, no new `Project` slice,
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` unchanged at 19. The graphics audit (confirm every plot the
  original suite rendered has a Streamlit equivalent) found no gaps.

- **Analysis merged into nine component pages** (Phase D Step D6). The 11
  per-BAS-program Analysis pages are now 9: **Wing Loads**
  (`app/views/wing_loads.py`) merges AIRLOADS (Schrenk) + WINGINER + NETLOADS
  behind one form; **Tail Loads** (`app/views/tail_loads.py`) merges TAILDIST +
  BALLOADS. `farloads/workflow.py`'s `wing_loads`/`tail_loads` steps are the
  shared nav step for each pair (`"airloads"`/`"balloads"` added to
  `FOLDED_MODULES`, reusing the existing `wing_inertia` precedent). The other 7
  pages (Engine Out, Fuselage Loads, Aileron, Flap, Tab, Engine Mount, Landing
  Gear) converted to the Phase-D page conventions: inputs moved into
  `st.form` + an explicit Apply button; Wing Loads' `Project.aero.surfaces`
  write-back changed from a wholesale replace to an upsert-by-name; Fuselage
  Loads' hardcoded 5-row station table and Engine Mount's baked-in Continental
  IO-520-BB `default_engine()` replaced with blank defaults; Aileron/Fuselage/
  Landing Gear/Engine Mount gained the LIMIT caption+marker they were missing.
  Engine Mount additionally retired its separate `st.session_state
  ["engine_inputs"]` store and ad hoc local `Project`, now reading/writing
  `Project.engines`/`Project.engine_layout`/`Project.include_far25` directly
  like every other page. No calc-math change; Appendix A/B oracles pass
  unmodified; `SCHEMA_VERSION` unchanged at 19 (pure GUI reorg).

- **Envelopes & Critical Conditions section** (Phase D Step D5,
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` 18 → 19). New **Weight/CG Grid & Payload Cases** page
  (`app/views/payload_cases.py`) owns a shared `WeightInput.cg_cases` list of
  named loading scenarios; the Weight/CG Envelope page's chart overlays them
  read-only against the forward-loading-envelope boundary, and the Flight
  Envelope page reads them read-only and merges them into the calc-facing
  `FlightLoadsInput.cg_cases` (unchanged for SELECT/WINGINER/NETLOADS/
  BALLOADS), so the two views can no longer diverge. Old project files migrate
  automatically (`io._legacy_cg_cases_from_flight_loads`). The Mach Limit
  page's chart now overlays the VA/VC/VD/VF design speeds as reference lines
  over the Mach-limit boundary. The Flight Envelope page exposes
  `FlightLoadsInput.altitudes_ft` as a real, fully-editable list (multi-altitude
  V-n), with a CG-case selector, an altitude selector and an "overlay all
  altitudes" toggle on the V-n chart. The Critical Loads page adds a per-
  condition opt-out checkbox persisted as `CriticalLoadSet.selected_case_ids`
  (empty = unfiltered); Results Review's governing-loads summary honors it —
  the structural calc modules and the sbeam export bridge are unaffected. No
  calc-math change; Appendix A/B oracles pass unmodified.

- **Form+Apply conversion, Airplane section** (Phase D Step D4.7, closing
  Phase D Step D4). `configuration_layout.py`, `wing_geometry.py`,
  `weight_estimate.py`, `weight_cg_inertia.py` and `structural_speeds.py`
  converted to `st.form`+explicit-Apply (matching `aero_coefficients.py`);
  every remaining Appendix-A-shaped literal default in these pages (GA6
  geometry, WTESTIMA mission figures, STRSPEED speeds/load-factor figures, the
  WINGGEOM Appendix-A wing polyline) replaced with 0/blank/derived defaults.

- **Engine write-back + mass-item overlay on the three-view** (Phase D Step
  D4.6). The Configuration & Layout page's three-view now overlays a marker
  per `Project.weight.items` `MassItem` (colored by `MassItemKind`, sized by
  `weight_lb`) and a diamond marker per `Project.engines[]` entry at its
  `engine_cg`, in all three views. A new "Engine positions (engine_cg)"
  expander lets you numerically override each engine's X/Y/Z station
  (defaulted to the current `engine_cg`); Apply writes back into
  `Project.engines` and re-renders the marker. Page-only change — no
  calc-math, no schema change.

- **True CG from `Project.mass`** (Phase D Step D4.5). New
  `farloads/modules/configuration.cg_estimate(project, layout, geom)` returns
  the weight-averaged CG station from `Project.mass.cases[0]` (WTONECG's
  itemized loading) when present, else the pre-existing `xlemac + 0.25*mac` /
  wing-reference-waterline first cut, plus a `source` label
  ("Weight DB" / "25% MAC estimate"). The landing-gear tip-back/overturn
  `ConditionResult` and the Configuration & Layout page's three-view CG marker
  (top and side views) both switch to it automatically once a mass slice
  exists, with the source named in the `ConditionResult` label and the
  three-view legend. Prop ground clearance is CG-independent and unaffected.
  No schema change.

- **Design-weight read-through, Structural Speeds / Weight Envelope** (Phase D
  Step D4.4). `app/views/structural_speeds.py` reads the design weight from
  `Project.weight.direct_totals()[0]` (the Weight DB total) when items exist,
  read-only with an "Override design weight" checkbox, instead of asking for
  it a second time; when no Weight DB is present it shows an info message
  pointing at the Weight, CG & Inertia page instead of falling back to a
  `3400.0`-shaped literal default (same treatment for its wing-area fallback,
  now `0.0` with its own info message; the pre-existing wing-area
  read-through from `Project.geometry` is unchanged). `app/views/weight_envelope.py`
  (WTENV) gets the same weight read-through + override checkbox for its
  `gross` weight. No calc-math or schema change; the GA6 example is
  unaffected since its stored `speeds.weight_lb` already equals its Weight DB
  total.

- **Component-station derivation + Weight DB seeding** (Phase D Step D4.3).
  `farloads/modules/configuration.py` gained two pure functions:
  `component_stations(layout)` derives approximate `(x, y, z)` stations for
  named airframe components (wing, fuselage, h-tail, v-tail, a lumped "tail"
  average, main/nose gear, a lumped "landing_gear" average) from
  `LayoutInput`'s existing coarse scalars — no schema change; and
  `match_component_station(name, stations)` maps a `MassItem.name` to one of
  those keys by case-insensitive substring alias, most-specific first. The
  Configuration & Layout page gained a "Seed component stations into Weight
  DB" button (mirroring the existing "Seed wing geometry" button) that fills
  a weight item's station only when it is still `(0, 0, 0)`, never
  overwriting a hand-entered value — closing the gap `estimate_to_mass_items`
  (WTESTIMA) leaves (component weights with no station). No calc-math or
  schema change.

- **Aero Coefficients page** (Phase D Step D4.2). New `app/views/aero_coefficients.py`
  is now the single owner of the `Project.aero_coeffs` slice (Step D4.1):
  a form+Apply page (page conventions §5) editing the cruise coefficient set
  plus an optional flaps-down (landing) set behind a checkbox, with no
  Appendix-A-shaped widget defaults (0/blank). Apply wholesale-replaces
  `project.aero_coeffs` — correct for this page since it is the slice's sole
  owner. `app/views/flight_envelope.py` drops the cruise-coefficient editor it
  carried since Step D4.1, gains a "no aero coefficients — define them on the
  Aero Coefficients page" guard alongside its existing missing-speeds guard,
  and shows the coefficients it reads as a read-only caption. No calc-math or
  schema change (reuses the D4.1 `Project.aero_coeffs` slice).

- **`Project.aero_coeffs` slice — single-owner airplane-less-tail aero
  coefficients** (Phase D Step D4.1). New `AeroCoefficientsInput` (`cruise`,
  `flaps_down`, both `Optional[AeroCoeffSet]`) replaces
  `FlightLoadsInput.configurations` (a list of `AeroCoeffSet` keyed by
  `flaps_down`), which is dropped from the schema. `flight_envelope`
  (FLTLOADS) now reads `Project.aero_coeffs` instead of owning the coefficient
  list; `select` and `balloads` read it too (via `select._flaps_by_config_name`)
  for the flaps-retracted/extended split. A new **Aero Coefficients** workflow
  step (`aero_coefficients`, Airplane section, `produces="aero_coeffs"`) and
  placeholder page (`app/views/aero_coefficients.py`, read-only) land in the
  nav; `flight_envelope`'s step now also `requires=("aero_coeffs",)`. The
  cruise-coefficient editor stays on the **Flight Envelope** page for now,
  writing into `Project.aero_coeffs.cruise` while preserving any existing
  `.flaps_down` set — it moves to the new page, plus a flaps-down editor, in
  Step D4.2. `SCHEMA_VERSION` 17 → 18; older project files (with
  `flight_loads.configurations`) migrate automatically
  (`io._legacy_aero_coeffs_from_flight_loads`) so they still load unchanged.
  No calc-math change (Appendix A/B oracles pass unmodified).

- **Local-disk project persistence + Engineer/Date metadata** (Phase D Step D3,
  decision D-3). `app/Home.py` now owns a global **Project file** sidebar
  widget (visible on every page): Open (from a local `projects/` directory,
  newest-first), New from example (`examples/*.project.json`), Save to disk
  (overwrites `<name>.project.json`), the existing browser upload/download, and
  an unsaved-changes indicator; Open/New-from-example confirm via a dialog
  before discarding unsaved edits. `farloads/io.py` gains
  `default_projects_dir()` (repo-relative, not cwd-relative) and
  `list_saved_projects()`. `Project.engineer`/`Project.date` (freeform text,
  blank by default) are new optional metadata, shown on the dashboard and as a
  header line in the Export & Report page's text report / zip bundle.
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` 16 → 17 (additive; omitted from the JSON when blank, so
  existing files round-trip unchanged). `projects/` is git-ignored. No
  calc-math change.

- **Structured load-case IDs** (Phase D Step D1, decision D-1). Every
  delivered load case now carries a stable, traceable `case_id`
  (`"<component>-<seq>"`, e.g. `W-01`, `HT-03`, `VT-02`, `F-04`, `EM-01`,
  `LG-05`) that replaces `report.py`'s old render-time, per-module, unstable
  `LC{idx}`. New `CaseRef` dataclass (`farloads/models.py`) and
  `farloads/case_ids.py` (the six-prefix taxonomy + a per-call-site
  `CaseIdAllocator`, no shared/global state). Minted once by the module that
  first names a physical condition (`select.py`, `engine.py`, `landing.py`,
  `aileron.py`, `flap.py`, `tab.py`, `one_engine_out.py`,
  `wing_inertia.py`/`net_loads.py`) and copied downstream by consumers
  (`taildist.py`, `body_loads.py`) rather than re-minted. `report.py`'s
  load-case tables gain `Component`/`Condition`/`CG`/`Speed`/`Altitude`
  columns; `export/sbeam_bridge.py` stamps the case id into every sbeam
  `FORCE`/`MOMENT` card comment and adds a new case-index CSV
  (`case_index_csv_from`/`case_index_rows`), surfaced on the Export page.
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` 15 → 16 (additive; older files load with `case_ref = None`,
  back-filled on the next compute). No calc-math change — the Appendix A/B
  oracles pass unmodified. **Accepted, not closed:** `select_wing`'s own wing
  `CriticalCondition` list and `WingMassInput.cases` (which drives
  WINGINER/NETLOADS) remain two independent case lists sharing the `W` prefix
  in disjoint numeric bands (not the same case object); same gap between
  `one_engine_out` and `select_vtail`'s vertical-tail sequence — tracked as a
  deferred refinement. See `docs/30_future/00_backlog.md` → history for the
  full design and the banding-collision bug caught during implementation.

### Changed

- `SCHEMA_VERSION` 32 → **33** for the new `safety_factor` field. Migration is
  lenient: a file predating it simply lacks the key and takes
  `ULTIMATE_FACTOR`, so every reloaded project exports identical numbers. The
  bundled `examples/*.project.json` are restamped.

- **Body-load moment-closure caveat on every deliverable (M3 pre-release
  obligation for M4-1).** The Ch 15 fuselage distribution applies a *single*
  vertical wing reaction, so it closes ΣFz but **not** ΣM — the terminal `Myy` is
  non-zero and the bending carries a net pitching couple (the Ref 1 p103
  front/rear-spar two-reaction solve is open work, backlog M4-1). The limitation
  is now single-sourced as `body_loads.CLOSURE_CAVEAT` and stamped onto every
  body-load deliverable: wrapped `$ CAVEAT:` comment lines opening each case
  block in `fuselage_loads.bdf` (`sbeam_bridge.body_force_moment_cards`), an
  `st.warning` on the **Net Fuselage Loads** page, and a caption under the
  **Export** page's Fuselage row. `tests/test_body_loads.py::
  test_body_bdf_carries_closure_caveat` locks it (one block per case, text
  matches the constant, comment lines ≤ 72 cols). En route, corrected the
  **overstated** Net Fuselage Loads caption — it claimed "Validated by
  equilibrium closure" on the exact axis that is known-open. No calc, schema or
  oracle change (`SCHEMA_VERSION` stays 32); the CSV export shape is untouched
  (`Case,GID,X,Fz,Sz,Myy`), so no parser breaks.

- **GUI editors for the blocking uncovered fields (M2R-5).** Two inputs that
  drove the results but had no on-screen knob (JSON-only) are now editable in the
  app. **(a) Landing CG cases** — a fixed 3-row `st.data_editor` on **Landing
  Loads** for `landing.cg_cases` (name / weight / Xcg / Zcg), seeded from the
  **WTENV structural CG envelope** (fwd/aft stations via the newly-public
  `validation.wtenv_cg_limits`, with the gross / fwd-regardless weights and the
  itemized-loading waterline) and editable from there; the page's hard "provide
  WTONECG or edit the JSON" gate is replaced by an in-place info until the three
  positive-weight rows are applied. **(b) SELECT search inputs** — a form on the
  **Critical Loads** tab for `SelectInput.full_down_aileron_deg` /
  `basic_airfoil_cm` / `wing_weight_lb` (each with `help=`), which drive the
  23.349(b) steady-roll wing-torsion score and the critical-fuselage wing weight
  and previously defaulted silently (0 / 0 / 0.09·MTOW). Both persist only on
  **Apply** (a plain render leaves the project byte-for-byte unchanged — the M2R-4
  guard, now covering `landing_loads` too). No calc or schema change
  (`SCHEMA_VERSION` stays 32); the two slices already round-trip in `io.py`. En
  route, promoted `validation._wtenv_cg_limits` → public `wtenv_cg_limits` and
  re-pointed the existing `app/views/weight_mass.py` importer (removes one
  `app/`-imports-`farloads`-underscore violation, per M4-12).

- **`project.json` data dictionary + GUI user guide (M2-11).** Two new docs.
  `docs/10_standard/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` is **generated** by
  `docs/generate_data_dict.py`, which introspects the `farloads.models` Project
  input slices (type/default from `dataclasses`/`typing.get_type_hints`, units
  from inline comments) and emits a per-slice map (owning page + consuming
  modules, at slice granularity from `workflow.py` + a source scan) plus a field
  table per input dataclass and an enums appendix; result slices are out of
  scope. `docs/10_standard/GUI_USER_GUIDE.md` is a task-oriented walkthrough —
  workflow phases, the single-source seed chain, LIMIT-vs-ULTIMATE reading rules,
  and an end-to-end `ga6_normal` example with four hand-checkable numbers.
  `tests/test_data_dictionary.py` guards the generated doc against drift.
- **Operating-limitation implications on the Design Speeds page (M2-10).** The
  structural design speeds (Subpart C) now explain and surface the **operating
  limitations / cockpit placards** they bound (Subpart G) — advisory only, no
  loads-math change. Three tiers: **Explain** (a constraint-ladder expander with
  citations); **Derive** (`operational_placards`/`operational_implications` in
  `structural_speeds.py` — a read-only panel showing **both** placard families:
  recip yellow-arc VNE=0.9·VD, VNO=min(VC, 0.89·VNE), MNE=0.9·MD and turbine
  VMO=VC/MMO=MC, plus VFE=VF); **Constrain** (optional operational targets
  `no_yellow_arc` + `target_vne`/`vno`/`vmo`/`mmo`/`vfe` on `StructuralSpeedsInput`,
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` 30 → 31 with lenient migration). Targets invert the ladder into
  the required design minima (`operational_target_checks`) and **warn-only** on
  infeasibility — never mutating a design speed or load; infeasible targets also
  surface on the dashboard via `validation._check_operational_targets`. Sources:
  new `reference/14CFR_operating_limitations.md` (14 CFR 23.1505/23.1511, web-
  verified; Ref 1 p47; 23.335(b)(4) margin). GA6 placards unit-tested (VNE 191.25,
  VNO 170, MNE 0.363, VMO 170, MMO 0.3226, VFE 105.5).

- **Persistence verification + guards (M2-7, Step G7).** Verified decision G-3: every
  input-bearing value lives on a `Project` slice `io.py` round-trips, with no input data
  stranded in `st.session_state`. New `tests/test_persistence.py`: (a) every example is a
  **save→reload no-op**; (b) a **field-coverage completeness guard** — each input dataclass
  is filled with all-non-default sentinels (recursively) and round-tripped through its `io`
  pair, so a field added later without `io` wiring fails the build (intentionally-derived
  fields sit in a rename-guarded `DERIVED_NOT_PERSISTED` allowlist); (c) a **session_state
  audit** — a static scan of `app/` asserting every `st.session_state[...] =` write uses an
  allow-listed UI key (`project`/`unit_system`/`_saved_project_snapshot`/`engine_sel` + the
  Project Editor scratchpad), so a new key that could smuggle input data outside `project`
  trips a review. The audit found the acceptance already met (the D5/G-series/M2-6
  single-source work); the Streamlit `key=`+`value=` display-freshness footgun is deferred
  to the L-8 long-tail batch.

- **Renamed the project `FAR23LOADS`/`farloads` → `sloads`; split `models.py` into a
  `models/` package (M3-1).** The Python package/import, CLI command
  (`sloads = "cli:main"`), GUI title/brand, README H1, doc-set titles, and
  `pyproject` name are now **`sloads`** (lowercase); the sbeam export deck headers and
  `export/` axis references are **`SLOADS`** (with `tests/test_workbook.py` updated in
  lockstep). The 1,862-line `models.py` monolith was split AST-deterministically
  (verified byte-identical) into `sloads/models/{enums,inputs,results,project}.py` with
  a re-exporting `__init__.py`, so every prior `from sloads.models import X` form
  resolves unchanged. **No calc/oracle/schema change** — `SCHEMA_VERSION` stays 32;
  registry names, JSON schema keys and session-state keys are untouched, so saved
  project files load as-is. The "FAR 23 LOADS" mark survives only as
  McMaster/DARcorporation attribution (disclaimer retained in README + GUI About); the
  repo folder name and historical CHANGELOG/`40_history` entries are intentionally left
  as-is. Full suite green (483 passed); ruff clean; smoke test exit 0.
- **Geometry & power single-source cleanup (M2-6, Step G6c).** Closed the last of the
  softer geometry/power double-entry the G6 audit surfaced. **Wing:**
  `FlightLoadsInput.mac`/`wing_area_sqft`/`xw`/`zw`, `WingMassInput.dihedral_deg`/
  `wrp_waterline` and `LandingInput.wing_area_sqft` are now **derived from
  `Project.geometry`** — MAC/S/XW from the WINGGEOM wing surface (`XW = XLEMAC +
  0.25·MAC`), ZW from the parametric wing (`root_waterline_z + Y_MAC·tan(dihedral)`),
  dihedral/wrp from the parametric wing — via a shared
  `farloads.derived_geometry.sync_geometry_derived` every consuming module calls (the
  `landing._sync_gear_from_geometry` pattern). They are no longer persisted and the GUI
  shows them read-only, so there is no independently-editable copy; a project with no
  wing geometry keeps its slice values (the STRSPEED fallback). **Fuselage:** the
  `GeometryInput.fuselage` outline is the sole editable shape source; the
  `LayoutInput.fuselage_length`/`_width`/`_height` scalars are a derived read-only
  summary of it (length = station span, width/height = max section), not persisted.
  **Power:** `WeightEstimationInput.max_continuous_hp` is single-sourced from
  `sum(engines[].max_cont_hp)` (new `resolve_max_continuous_hp`), overridable behind the
  new `override_max_continuous_hp` toggle; the per-engine vs combined-total and
  takeoff vs max-continuous concepts stay distinct. `SCHEMA_VERSION` 29 → 30 (lenient:
  older files' stored copies are read but ignored/re-derived, the fuselage outline is
  defaulted from the length/width/height scalars when absent, `override` defaults False).
  All six shipped examples migrated (GA6 gained a parametric wing slice; the derived
  values fold in within Appendix A ±0.1% — ZW 87.725 → 87.734); every example is a
  save→reload no-op. Calc unchanged; Appendix A oracles bit-for-bit.

- **Navigation: whole workflow visible + cross-page links (M2-2, review
  G3+G6).** (a) `st.navigation(..., expanded=True)` in `app/Home.py` so all eight
  sidebar groups (Start + the six analysis phases, **including Export**) stay open
  on first run instead of collapsing phases 3–6 behind a "View 10 more" expander
  (G3). (b) A workflow-derived link helper — `components.workflow_page_link(key)`
  and `components.gate(message, *keys)` — that derives every link's target path
  *and* label from `farloads.workflow` (the single source of navigation truth), so
  a page rename re-labels every link automatically and hand-typed stale page names
  can't recur. (c) The **Project Dashboard** checklist rows are now `st.page_link`s
  (status emoji as icon, summary/status/BAS in the tooltip); blocked steps stay
  navigable so the user lands on the page and reads its own now-linked gating
  message. (d) Every "define X on the Y page first" gate across 14 views now
  renders a page link to the page that unblocks it, and the **stale page names**
  from the G1 merge are fixed — "Wing Geometry" / "Configuration & Layout" →
  **Geometry**, "Flight Envelope" → **Flight Envelope (V-n)**. The helper degrades
  to a non-clickable label when run outside `st.navigation` (e.g. AppTest), so
  standalone rendering never breaks. Bumped the `streamlit` floor to `>=1.36`
  (`st.navigation(expanded=…)`). New `tests/test_page_links.py` asserts every link
  key resolves to a real workflow step with a matching view file. GUI-only; no
  calc/schema change (424 tests green, `ruff` clean).

- **AIRLOAD4 Mach threshold 0.4 verified and documented (M1-8).** The design-Mach
  gate that auto-selects the swept/high-Mach AIRLOAD4 branch (`_AIRLOAD4_MACH = 0.4`)
  was flagged against the FAA User's Guide's **0.5** (§9.1, §10.1). Verification
  confirmed **0.4 is sourced to Ref 1** (Ch 12: *"AIRLOAD4.BAS for Mach >.4 or
  sweepback > 15 degrees"*, `FAR23Loads_Code.pdf`); the User's Guide is the outlier
  and no `.BAS` oracle pins the value (selection was a human-operator choice, not a
  hardcoded comparison). Ref 1's **0.4** is retained — higher-authority source, the
  conservative gate, and nearly moot for output since compressibility enters via
  FLTLOADS' upstream Glauert `CL`. **No code value change**; a source-conflict note
  was added to `airloads.py`, `docs/20_theory/00_theory_sources.md` and
  `docs/10_standard/PROGRAM_SPEC.md`.

- **23.427(a) unsymmetrical tail: restore the full candidate set (M1-4, review T6;
  approved oracle deviation).** `select_htail_unsymmetrical` no longer filters the
  **unchecked** maneuvers out of the 23.427 search. `SELECT.BAS` lines 6070–6175
  (Ref 1 Appendix C p440–441) load the unchecked cases into the candidate array
  (`L(5)=U1CK`, `L(6)=U2CK`) and take the max over all 12 conditions; 23.427(a)
  applies the unsymmetrical distribution to "the loads prescribed in 23.421
  **through** 23.425", spanning the 23.423 unchecked case. The earlier exclusion
  (citing a "CAM 3.216" rationale) was an undocumented, non-conservative deviation.
  On the Appendix A GA6 the DN unchecked maneuver governs, so the unsymmetrical
  total moves from **−1111.8 → −1204.7** (RH −700.4, LH −504.3, 72%). The Appendix A
  sample output's −1111.8 (gust-governed) is a **stale printout from a superseded
  `SELECT.BAS` revision** — it is inconsistent with its own Appendix C listing, which
  the larger unchecked case (`U2CK` = −1397.835) would win. The listing + the CFR
  are authoritative. The governing condition carries a documented `note`;
  `CriticalCondition` gains a `note` field. `test_htail_gust_and_unsymmetrical_match_appendix_a`
  updated (manual's −1111.8 kept in a comment). Source:
  `reference/23_427_unsymmetrical_candidate_set.md`; register in `CLAUDE.md`.

- **Single-source stall from CLmax (M1-1b; closes old 2-13(b)).** Stall speeds are
  no longer hand-entered scalars. The maximum lift coefficients live once on
  `AeroCoefficientsInput` — `clmax_clean` / `clmax_clean_neg` / `clmax_flap` — and
  STRSPEED, `flap` and `one_engine_out` **derive** VS/VSF from them at the design
  weight (`constants.stall_speed_kt`: `VS = √(295·(W/S)/CLmax)`, User's Guide p7-5),
  which in turn set VA and VF. The `StructuralSpeedsInput.stall_clean_kt` /
  `stall_flap_kt` fields are removed; CLmax is entered on the **Aerodynamic Data**
  page, which now precedes **Structural Speeds** in the workflow (STRSPEED
  `requires=("aero_coeffs",)`). The FLTLOADS balance clamp `AeroCoeffSet.stall_cl`
  stays authored per config (it can differ from the stall-speed CLmax by the 0.9
  stall-margin factor — e.g. Appendix A ga6: `clmax_clean` 1.4068 from the printed
  VS vs FLTLOADS `stall_cl` 1.41); `AeroCoefficientsInput.__post_init__` fills either
  representation from the other only when one is missing, never overwriting. All
  Appendix-A oracles (STRSPEED VA/VF and the FLTLOADS/SELECT envelope) are preserved
  exactly. `SCHEMA_VERSION` → 29; example projects updated.

- **Single-source landing-gear geometry (Phase G, Step G6b).** The tricycle-gear
  geometry native to LANDLOAD — main/nose axle `(X, Z)` at the three strut states,
  rolling radius, strut type, and the main-wheel tread — is now entered **once**, on
  the Geometry page, in a new `GeometryInput.landing_gear` (`LandingGearGeometry`).
  It drives both the three-view (strut + wheels, ground line) and the ground-load
  analysis: `landing.build_landing` syncs it onto `Project.landing` before the
  reaction solve, so the LANDLOAD math is unchanged. The duplicated coarse
  `LayoutInput` gear fields (`main_gear_x`/`nose_gear_x`/`track`/`gear_height`) are
  retired — the three-view and the tip-back/overturn/prop-clearance estimate now
  **derive** the station/track/height from the native axle geometry (ground = static
  axle `Z` − rolling radius), so a stored coarse height that disagreed with the axles
  no longer diverges silently. The Landing Loads page drops its gear/tread widgets
  (reads the geometry read-only), keeping only the non-geometry LANDLOAD inputs. `io`
  migrates a pre-v28 file's top-level `landing` gear (and legacy `LayoutInput` gear
  fields) into `geometry.landing_gear`; `SCHEMA_VERSION` 27 → 28. **Appendix A gear
  reactions unchanged bit-for-bit** (`tests/test_landing_gear_geometry.py`,
  `tests/test_landing.py`).
- **Single-source empennage & control-surface geometry (Phase G, Step G6).** The
  horizontal-/vertical-tail + **elevator/rudder** geometry is now entered **once**,
  on the Geometry page, and drives both the three-view and the rational tail-load
  analysis. A new `GeometryInput.empennage` (`EmpennageInput{htail, vtail}`) is the
  single stored home; `Project.tail_loads`/`.vtail_loads` become **properties**
  proxying to it (so SELECT/TAILDIST/BALLOADS/one-engine-out read them unchanged),
  and the duplicated `LayoutInput` h-/v-tail area/span/arm fields are retired (the
  three-view and the tail-volume static-margin estimate now read the analysis-native
  values; the tail arm is derived from `xt25`/`xv25` minus the 25% wing-MAC station,
  not stored twice). The **three-view draws the elevator and rudder** as the aft
  `Saft/S` chord band, and the Geometry page gains an *Empennage & control surfaces*
  editor (the elevator/rudder geometry's first GUI home — previously JSON-only); the
  Tail Loads page becomes analysis-only (reads the geometry read-only). `io` migrates
  a pre-v27 file's top-level `tail_loads`/`vtail_loads` (and the retired `LayoutInput`
  tail fields) into `geometry.empennage`; `SCHEMA_VERSION` 26 → 27. The derived
  slices are byte-identical, so the **Appendix A SELECT tail-load oracles are
  unchanged** (`tests/test_empennage.py`, `tests/test_select.py`).

- **Phase-1 page consolidation — Develop V-n diagram (Phase G, Step G3).** The
  *Develop V-n diagram* section collapses from ten nav pages to five, using
  `st.tabs` where a page gathers formerly-separate pages. New **Weight & Mass
  Properties** page (`app/views/weight_mass.py`) with tabs *Estimate* (WTESTIMA) ·
  *Weight, CG & Inertia* (WTONECG) · *Payload Cases* · *Weight / CG Envelope*
  (WTENV) — the single owner of all weight/mass data. **Structural Speeds** gains a
  *Design Speeds* / *Speed–Altitude Envelope* (MACHLIM) tab split; **Flight Envelope
  (V-n)** gains a *V-n diagram* / *Critical Loads (SELECT)* tab split (the FLTLOADS
  balance inputs stay on the page, shared by both tabs). Six view files are deleted
  and folded (`weight_estimate`, `weight_cg_inertia`, `payload_cases`,
  `weight_envelope`, `mach_limit`, `critical_loads`); `workflow.FOLDED_MODULES` gains
  `weight_estimate`, `weight_envelope`, `mach_limit`, `select` (each still a
  registered/tested calc module, now without its own nav step). **No calc, schema,
  or oracle change** — the folded modules and `Project` slices are untouched; only
  which page edits a slice moved. Cross-page captions/warnings updated to the new tab
  locations.
- **Workflow-aligned navigation re-sequence (Phase G, Step G2).** The GUI sidebar
  is re-grouped from the historical Phase-D sections into the FAR 23 analysis flow
  (decision G-4): an un-numbered **Start** app-shell group (Project Dashboard, JSON
  Editor) above the six numbered analysis phases **1 · Develop V-n diagram → 2 ·
  Flight loads → 3 · Other loads → 4 · Landing loads → 5 · Load-case plotting → 6 ·
  Export**. The old **Airplane**/**Envelopes & Critical Conditions** split dissolves
  — geometry, all weight/CG pages, both speed pages, aero data, and V-n + SELECT now
  sit together under *Develop V-n diagram*; *Landing Loads* moves after the
  control-surface/engine *Other loads* group. `farloads/workflow.py` (`PHASES`
  renamed, `STEPS` reordered/reassigned) and `app/Home.py` (`_PHASE_LABEL`) carry the
  change; the Dashboard caption follows. **Grouping/labels only — no page bodies, no
  calc, no schema change** (the per-page consolidation into §4's 1a–1e sub-steps is
  the separate Step G3). The nav-drift guard test stays green.
- **Geometry single source of truth, incl. fuselage (Phase G, Step G1).** The two
  geometry-owning pages — Configuration & Layout (parametric `LayoutInput`) and
  Wing / Surface Geometry (WINGGEOM planforms) — are merged into **one Geometry
  page**, and their two project slices are **unified into one** (`SCHEMA_VERSION`
  **24 → 25**): the parametric layout (formerly the top-level `Project.configuration`)
  and a new **fuselage outline** move onto `GeometryInput` as `.parametric` and
  `.fuselage`, alongside the unchanged `.surfaces`. The oracle-locked `.surfaces`
  consumers (AIRLOADS, WINGINER, NETLOADS, …) are untouched. The **fuselage is now a
  real geometry entity** — a station-area table (`FuselageOutline`/`FuselageSection`,
  cross-section width/height vs. station) that drives the three-view body profile and
  seeds the future Step G4 pitching-moment estimator; older files default it from the
  `fuselage_length/width/height` scalars on load. Downstream pages (flight envelope,
  structural speeds, weight, tail/wing loads, aircraft comparison) read geometry
  **read-only** through the unified slice. `workflow.py` collapses to one **Geometry**
  step (the `wing_geometry` module is folded in via `FOLDED_MODULES`); legacy project
  files migrate on load (`io.py` folds the top-level `"configuration"` block onto
  `geometry.parametric`). **Appendix A/B oracles unchanged.** New tests:
  fuselage-outline default + round-trip (`test_configuration.py`, `test_io.py`) and
  the legacy-`configuration`→`geometry` migration (`test_io.py`).
- **Canonical display units — one unit per dimension (Phase G, Step G0).** The GUI
  now shows a single unit per physical dimension: **length → `in` (SI `mm`), area →
  `ft²` (SI `m²`)**. The geometry inputs that previously carried a different unit are
  renamed to canonical-unit field names and stored in canonical units
  (**`SCHEMA_VERSION` 23 → 24**): `TailLoadsInput.airplane_length_ft` and
  `VTailLoadsInput.{airplane_length_ft, wing_span_ft, vtail_mac_ft}` → `*_in` (×12);
  `LayoutInput.{h_tail_span_ft, v_tail_span_ft}` → `*_in` (×12);
  `TabSpec.area_sqin` → `area_sqft` (÷144). The redundant `length_ft`/`area_sqin`
  kinds are removed from `farloads/units.py` (`SI_PER_IMPERIAL`, `UNIT_LABELS`,
  `_KIND_FACTORS`); `_PROJECT_FIELD_KIND` maps the renamed keys. **Calc results are
  unchanged** — the original ft/in² math is restored internally, so the Appendix A/B
  oracles are untouched. Older project files migrate on load (`io.py`
  `_rename_legacy_units`); the bundled `examples/*.json` (older schema versions) load
  via that path. New guardrail tests: one-label-per-dimension (`test_units.py`) and
  legacy-key migration (`test_io.py`).

- **Fleet comparison moved to its own page (Phase F, Step F2).** The shared
  `app/components.render_fleet_comparison` helper (its private `_fleet_points` /
  `_fleet_readout`) and the fleet block on **Configuration & Layout** and **Weight
  Estimate** are removed; the comparison now lives only on the new Aircraft
  Comparison page. `app/components.py` retains just the FAR 23 applicability banner.

- **Mach Limit page reworked into the Speed–Altitude Envelope (Phase E, Step E7).**
  MC, MD and the shoulder altitude are now read from the Structural Speeds `speeds`
  slice instead of being re-entered — only the max operating altitude and increment
  remain as inputs. The chart is now a transport-category-style speed–altitude
  flight-limits diagram: altitude on the y-axis, a **KEAS/KCAS/KTAS** selectable
  x-axis, a constant-Mach fan, and the design-speed boundary drawn EAS-limited below
  the shoulder and Mach-limited above it (VC/MC and VD/MD kink at the shoulder). The
  workflow step is retitled "Speed–Altitude Envelope". GUI + one new pure helper; no
  calc-math or oracle change (`mach_limit_lines` untouched).

- **V-n diagram consolidated onto the Flight Envelope page (Phase E, Step E6).**
  The suite had two V-n diagrams: the continuous LIMIT textbook envelope on the
  **Structural Speeds** page (Step E3) and the rigorous, Mach-corrected balanced
  corner points on the **Flight Envelope (V-n)** page — redundant. The continuous
  LIMIT envelope (from the pure `farloads/vn_diagram.py` helper) is now drawn as a
  grey backdrop on the Flight Envelope page, behind the rigorous balanced markers,
  so the envelope visibly *bounds* them in a single figure. It is rebuilt there from
  `project.speeds` (already a required slice) via `design_speed_values` — no new
  inputs. The Structural Speeds page now shows only its numeric design-speed tables
  plus a pointer to the Flight Envelope page. GUI-only; no calc math changed
  (`vn_diagram` and its tests are untouched).

- **Load-path robustness (Phase E, Step E5).** The three sidebar load actions
  (Open saved, Load example, Upload) now fail **gracefully**: a malformed or
  wrong-shape file shows an `st.error` ("Couldn't load …: …") instead of an
  uncaught traceback, matching the JSON Editor's behavior. Both the sidebar and the
  Project JSON Editor now run a **soft `SCHEMA_VERSION` check**: a file from a
  *newer* app version warns and still loads (unrecognized fields ignored); an
  *older* file is migrated in place (its field-presence migration already ran in
  `io.py`; the version stamp is bumped to the current `SCHEMA_VERSION`), surfaced as
  a brief toast in the sidebar / an info line in the editor. The classification is
  the new pure, unit-tested `farloads.io.schema_status(version) -> (status,
  message)` (no Streamlit). GUI-only: no schema change (`SCHEMA_VERSION` stays
  **22**) and no calc-math change — the Appendix A/B oracles are untouched (347
  tests pass, +4). Implements `GUI_design.md §10`.

- **Six-section GUI navigation restructure** (Phase D Step D2, regroup only).
  `farloads/workflow.py`'s four phases (Define/Analyze/Review/Export) are
  replaced with the six Phase-D sections: Start, Airplane, Envelopes &
  Critical Conditions, Analysis, Loads Plots, Export. `airloads` moves from
  Define into Analysis; `balanced_tail_verification` and `critical_loads` move
  alongside their related pages (Analysis and Envelopes & Critical Conditions
  respectively); `results_review` moves into Export (pre-export summary,
  alongside `export_report`). The dashboard is now a real `WorkflowStep`
  (`"dashboard"`, phase Start) instead of a Home.py special case, so
  `app/Home.py` builds every sidebar group — including Start — uniformly from
  `wf.by_phase()`; a section with no steps yet (`Loads Plots`, pending Step D7)
  is omitted from the sidebar rather than shown empty. No page merges, no
  calc-math or schema change — `requires`/`produces` on every step are
  unchanged; this is metadata + display only.

### Fixed

- **2026-07-23 review nits batch (M4-16).** (1) **[CRITICAL]**
  `docs/10_standard/GUI_design.md`'s "currently `SCHEMA_VERSION = …`" paragraph
  was stale for the **third** time (still 32 after the M4-7 bump to 33) — fixed,
  the migration-history list gains the `v33 M4-7 per-case safety_factor` row,
  and a new guard test
  (`tests/test_data_dictionary.py::test_gui_design_schema_line_current`) asserts
  the line matches `models.SCHEMA_VERSION`, making a fourth regression
  unmergeable. (2) `sbeam_bridge._sf()` is now typed (`Union` of the four
  distributed-load result types) and reads `safety_factor` directly — the
  `getattr` fallback only served hand-built doubles while masking a future
  attribute rename (every producer mints the field since M4-13). (3) The SF on
  deliverables renders as `SF=1.0`, not `SF=1` (`_sf_str` helper across the card
  `$` headers, closure comments and the four CSV `SF` columns). (4) `io.py`'s
  intra-package imports reordered alphabetically (`.constants` moved above the
  `.models` block).

- **Analysis-page LIMIT CSV downloads now carry their basis in the file
  (defect M4-15, 2026-07-23 review MINOR, contract).** The Wing Loads page's
  "Download net wing loads (CSV)" (and, found by the sweep, the Fuselage Loads
  CSV and the Loads Plots comparison CSV) shipped **LIMIT** station loads with
  no marker and a neutral filename — the on-page "(LIMIT)" caption did not
  travel with the file, violating the CLAUDE.md ultimate-deliverable contract.
  Now: the canonical station-row shapes (`net_loads.wing_load_rows`,
  `body_loads.body_load_rows`) append an in-band **`Basis = LIMIT`** column;
  every LIMIT download is filename-marked `*_LIMIT.csv` (wing, fuselage, loads
  plots, plus the already-column-marked tail-chordwise and one-engine-out
  files); the Loads Plots CSV `Field` strings gain the `, LIMIT` marker its
  plot axes already showed; and the Wing/Fuselage Loads pages add a
  side-by-side **ULTIMATE** download (`*_ULT.csv`, per-case `SF` column) routed
  through the existing `sbeam_bridge.span_load_csv` /
  `body_span_load_csv` renderers (user decision 2026-07-23: offer both). A new
  source-scan guard, `tests/test_ultimate_contract.py`, fails any future view
  that offers a load CSV with no basis marking and no ULTIMATE channel.

- **A corrupt persisted `safety_factor` can no longer crash or under-scale the
  export (defect M4-14, 2026-07-23 review MAJOR).** The five `io.py` readers
  added by M4-7 took `d.get("safety_factor", ULTIMATE_FACTOR)` unchecked, and
  the field is hand-editable (Project JSON Editor / the file itself):
  `"safety_factor": null` crashed `body_span_load_csv` with a `TypeError`
  (breaking the lenient-reader contract), and `0.5` silently **under-scaled**
  every exported card while still labelled ULTIMATE — including on the headless
  `cli.py --export-sbeam` path where no GUI warning can surface. The readers now
  coerce through one helper (`io._safety_factor`): anything non-numeric (null,
  string, bool, NaN/inf) **or outside the legal [1.0, 1.5] band** (14 CFR
  23.303; the factor is owned by the load-case definition — a case already at
  ultimate is 1.0, an agreed 23.302/25.302 failure-case factor lies between)
  falls back to the conservative `ULTIMATE_FACTOR` default. Companion
  advisories: a new `safety_factor_out_of_range` consistency warning
  (`validation._check_safety_factors`, rendered on the Export page) covers
  in-session values, and the Project JSON Editor scans the **raw** edited dict
  at Apply — the built project is already coerced, so only the raw dict can
  show what was typed — and warns that the value was reset. The shared
  predicate is the new public `validation.safety_factor_valid`. GA path
  unchanged (the fixture stays warning-free); covered by
  null/string/bool/NaN/0.5/negative/0.999/1.6 fixtures, legal-band round-trips
  at 1.0/1.25/1.5, and the exact null-then-export repro.

- **Wing and control-surface producers now mint their per-case safety factor
  once (defect M4-13, 2026-07-23 review MAJOR).** M4-7 threaded the factor for
  the tail and fuselage families only; `net_loads` (`WingLoadResult`) and
  `aileron`/`flap`/`tab` (`ControlSurfaceLoadResult`) left their result slice
  **and** their rendered `ConditionResult` to default the field independently —
  two sources of truth that would let the report and the exported FORCE/MOMENT
  cards disagree at the first non-1.5 case. Each of the four modules now mints
  the factor once in `build_*` (`net_loads` sets it on the air, inertia and net
  families of the same case; aileron's up/down throws share one mint) and
  `run()` copies it from the built result — the taildist/body pattern, closing
  the `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` §5 "minted once, copied unchanged" invariant. Aileron's
  `ConditionResult` also gains its previously missing `case_ref`, and its
  rendered pressures/loads now come from the same result records the export
  consumes. **Every number is unchanged** (all factors are 1.5); locked by an
  agreement test plus a mutation test that forces a 1.25 mint through each
  `run()` (`tests/test_sbeam_bridge.py`).

- **The sbeam export now scales by each case's own safety factor (defect M4-7).**
  `export/sbeam_bridge` hardcoded a flat `_SF = 1.5` at every scaling site and
  ignored `ConditionResult.safety_factor` — latent, because the four
  distributed-load result types it consumes carried **no** factor at all, so a
  case already at ultimate (`SF = 1.0`, per the ultimate-load contract) would have
  been multiplied by 1.5 a second time, and a future 14 CFR 23.302 / Appendix K
  probability-based factor could never reach the exported cards. `safety_factor`
  (default `constants.ULTIMATE_FACTOR` = 1.5) is now a field on `CriticalCondition`,
  `WingLoadResult`, `BodyLoadResult`, `TailChordResult` and
  `ControlSurfaceLoadResult`; TAILDIST and the fuselage net distribution copy it
  from the governing `CriticalCondition` (and TAILDIST's rendered `ConditionResult`
  carries the same value, so the report and the export can never disagree); the
  bridge resolves it per result via `_sf()`. **Every number is unchanged** — all
  defaults are 1.5 — verified by diffing the GA wing span CSV and FORCE/MOMENT
  cards before and after.
- The `$ Loads are ULTIMATE (limit x 1.5)` card comment, previously a hardcoded
  string on all four component families, now states the factor actually applied
  (`limit x SF=<sf>`).
- `io._critical_condition_from_dict` silently dropped `CriticalCondition.note` on
  reload, losing the approved-correction provenance a condition carries; it now
  round-trips.

- **`MissingInputError` — genuine calc defects no longer vanish from run-all (M2R-8).**
  `run_all_modules` caught *every* `ValueError`, so a real defect in a module was
  indistinguishable from "its inputs aren't entered" and silently disappeared from
  run-all/export. Added `MissingInputError(ValueError)` (`models.py`), raised at every
  module's input-absence guards (slice is `None`, a required upstream result/geometry/
  aero slice is absent, or a required input list is empty), and narrowed
  `run_all_modules` to catch **only** that — a plain `ValueError` (invalid domain input
  such as `<2` cylinders / non-positive area / mismatched element counts, or a genuine
  defect) now propagates and is visible. `MissingInputError` subclasses `ValueError`,
  so every existing `except ValueError` (GUI pages, CLI) still catches it; only the
  registry narrowed. The error-handling contract (`docs/10_standard/00_program_overview.md`)
  is updated to match. **While in the area:** `select.build_critical` now builds the V-n
  envelope **once** and threads it into all seven `select_*` searches (via a new
  `envelope=` parameter and the single `_envelope` fallback site) instead of each
  rebuilding it — up to a 7× saving when no envelope is persisted (the test suite runs
  noticeably faster). No calc/oracle change; the SELECT figures are unchanged.

- **`io.py` tolerant readers — unknown fields no longer crash load (M2R-7).** A
  project file carrying one field this app version doesn't recognize (saved by a
  newer or older build, or hand-edited) crashed on load with e.g.
  `MassItem.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument …`, despite
  `schema_status()` promising "unrecognized fields are ignored". Every `*_from_dict`
  now routes its `cls(**d)` splat through one shared `_filtered(cls, d)` helper that
  drops keys not belonging to the target dataclass — the ~21 raw splats
  (`MassItem`, `EngineInput`, `WeightEnvelopeInput`, `CgCase`, `MachLimitInput`,
  `StructuralSpeedsInput`, `LoadValue`, `VnPoint`, `TailBalanceLoad`, `MassCase`,
  `FuselageStation`, the wing/body/tail/control station-load families, `CaseRef`, …)
  plus the pre-existing ad-hoc filter comprehensions all share it. Additive
  forward-compat: known fields load, unknown ones are ignored, missing ones take
  their defaults. Tests poison **every** slice of `ga6_normal` (and the result
  slices it lacks — envelope/mass/loads/one_engine_out, with nested VnPoint/CaseRef/
  LoadValue/station objects) with an unknown key and assert load succeeds and
  re-serializes identically. No schema change; the full migration-chain overhaul
  stays M4-10.

- **Geometry Apply validates before persisting (M2R-6).** The **Geometry** page's
  sidebar *Apply geometry* used to store whatever was typed — including an invalid
  wing (e.g. Area S = 0) — which then crashed `configuration_properties` in the page
  body and hit `st.stop()`, blanking the *unrelated* empennage / landing-gear /
  fuselage-outline / surfaces forms further down. Apply now validates the candidate
  `LayoutInput` first (`_layout_errors`: positive area, aspect ratio and taper λ) and,
  when invalid, rejects the Apply with a targeted message while keeping the last valid
  layout — so the rest of the page stays alive. GUI-only; no calc or schema change.

- **Kill the last on-render `Project` mutation (M2R-4).** Opening the **Landing
  Loads** page no longer flips 🟠 *Unsaved changes*: `landing.build_landing()`
  wrote gear geometry, a derived gross-weight default, and the LGFACTOR result
  back onto `Project.landing` on every render, so merely visiting the page dirtied
  the project and `run()` was impure in the calc layer. `build_landing`/`run` are
  now **pure** — the gear geometry (from the single-source
  `geometry.landing_gear`) and the gross-weight default are resolved onto a local
  *effective* input copy via `dataclasses.replace` (`_effective_gear_input`),
  nothing is written to `Project`. The airplane load factor N is returned on
  `LoadFactorResult.airplane_load_factor` (already displayed by the view); the
  redundant write-back `LandingInput.n` field is removed. **Schema:**
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` 31 → **32**; migration is lenient (the tolerant
  `landing_from_dict` ignores an older file's `"n"` key). Added a
  render-leaves-project-unchanged test (the exact `_has_unsaved_changes`
  predicate); the Appendix-A ground-load oracle is byte-identical (the math runs
  on an identical effective input).

- **Ship working examples (M2R-3).** Bundled examples no longer dead-end a
  first-time user with a red error on Fuselage Loads or Landing Loads. Authored
  five examples to a clean end-to-end run (all six workflow phases): added
  `fuselage_mass` to `ga6_normal` / `cessna_210`; a 3rd landing `cg_case` to
  `concept_regional_jet`; and `fuselage_mass` + a `landing` slice (3 CG cases) +
  `geometry.landing_gear` to `dhc8_dash8` / `atr42_100`. Station masses and CG
  cases are derived from each file's own weight items / wing MAC / weight
  envelope. `concept_heavy` is intentionally kept as the minimal concept-core
  demo (V-n → Flight Envelope only) and documented as such in the README and GUI
  user guide. Data-only — no calc or schema change (`SCHEMA_VERSION` stays 31);
  three fixture-coupled tests updated for the completed state.

- **`scripts/smoke_test.sh` portability (M2-9).** The release smoke test hardcoded
  `$ROOT_DIR/.venv/bin/{python,streamlit,farloads}` and failed on any layout without a
  project-local `.venv` (conda, `pyenv`, system, or a differently-named venv). It now
  resolves a single interpreter — explicit `PYTHON` override → `.venv` when present →
  `python3`/`python` on PATH — and invokes tooling through it (`"$PYTHON" -m streamlit run`,
  `"$PYTHON" cli.py engine`); the three-way `-x` guard becomes one usable-interpreter check
  plus an `import streamlit, farloads` probe. Script-only; no calc/schema/module change.

- **Landing CG cases: require three explicit distinct loadings + concept 23.473(g)
  floor (M2-8, review — landing minor).** `landing._cg_cases` previously auto-derived
  the fwd/aft max-landing pair from the **single heaviest** `Project.mass` case, so
  both max-landing corners were byte-for-byte identical — a **degenerate** fwd/aft
  distinction that under-predicted the nose-gear and braked-roll reactions (their
  `AP/BP/CP` lever arms turn on `xcg`) whenever a project leaned on the fallback;
  UG fig 18.2 uses three genuinely distinct loadings. LANDLOAD now **requires**
  `landing.cg_cases` (three distinct entries) and raises a clear error when it is
  empty rather than silently building the degenerate pair; the WTENV structural
  fwd/aft CG limits (`validation._wtenv_cg_limits`) are the intended source. Added a
  **concept-mode-only, warn-only** 23.473(g) floor note on the LGFACTOR condition when
  `N < 2.67` or `NLG < 2.0`; the computed `N`/`NLG` are unchanged, so the Appendix-A
  oracle (3.0951 / 2.4281, both above the floors) is untouched. All six shipped
  examples already carry explicit `cg_cases`, so none regress. New tests in
  `tests/test_landing.py` (missing-`cg_cases` raise; the floor note present in concept
  mode and absent in FAR23). Calc-local; no schema change (457 tests green, `ruff` clean).

- **Aircraft Comparison: subject geometry from the wing surface + a Develop-phase
  link (M2-5, review G7).** The comparison **subject** read wing geometry only from
  `geometry.parametric` (the `LayoutInput`), so of the six shipped examples only
  `concept_regional_jet` (the one with a parametric layout) showed a wing area,
  aspect ratio or span — every other example printed "—" for W/S, span and AR
  because they carry `geometry.surfaces` (WINGGEOM planforms) instead. Added a wing-
  surface fallback via `wing_geometry.surface_properties(geometry.by_name("wing"))`
  (the same pattern the Flight Envelope page uses): wing **area** priority is now
  `parametric → WINGGEOM surface → speeds.wing_area_sqft`; **aspect ratio** and
  **span** fall back `parametric → surface`; and `Subject.wingspan_ft` is populated
  directly from the surface span (rather than back-derived from √(AR·area)). Every
  shipped example now places fully on the fleet scatters (e.g. GA-6 recovers AR 6.095
  / span 33.5 ft from its wing planform). The page **stays in the Export phase**
  (unchanged `workflow.py` order); a workflow-derived `page_link` on the **Weight &
  Mass Properties** page now points to it so the fleet check is reachable at
  definition time. Presentation-only — the reference fleet is never a FAR input, so
  no calc/oracle/schema change. Extended `tests/test_aircraft_comparison.py`.
- **Governing-loads tables now render ULTIMATE with units + SF (M2-4, review
  G5).** The "Governing loads (SELECT)" tables on **Results Review** and the
  **Flight Envelope → Critical Loads** tab hand-formatted each cell as
  `round(lv.value, 2)` — dropping `LoadValue.units`, the mandatory `-ULT` marker
  and the safety factor, printing literal `None` in the sparse cells where
  components carry different label sets, and (the substantive bug) **never applying
  the limit→ultimate factor** — so both consolidation surfaces were showing
  unmarked LIMIT loads as if they were the deliverable, violating the
  ultimate-output contract. Both tables now render through one shared
  `report.governing_loads_table(conditions, system, sf)` helper built on the
  existing `report.py` ultimate boundary (promoted to the public wrappers
  `ultimate_units` / `to_ultimate`): load columns scale by the SF and carry `-ULT`
  in the header (`lbs-ULT`, `ft-lb-ULT`; SI `N-ULT`, `Nm-ULT`); dimensionless/speed
  columns (n, CL, V) pass through unscaled and unmarked; a trailing `SF` column
  states the factor (flat 1.5 per 14 CFR 23.303 — the per-case carrier on
  `CriticalCondition` is deferred to M4-8); and absent cells render `"—"` (no
  `None`/NaN). The two views can no longer diverge (same helper). The duplicated
  `_display_loads` in both views is deleted in favor of the shared one. Render-only:
  no calc/oracle/model/schema change (the calc still emits LIMIT; Appendix A
  oracles untouched). New `tests/test_results_review.py`.
- **"Unsaved changes" no longer trips on a plain page visit (M2-3, review G4).**
  `flight_envelope.py` and `structural_speeds.py` auto-seeded derived slices on
  every render (`flight_loads`; `speeds.mach_limit`), so merely visiting them
  dirtied the project and fired the discard-confirm dialog spuriously — violating
  the app's own "Form + Apply, merge not replace" convention. Both now persist
  **only on an explicit Apply** (`st.form_submit_button`): the FLTLOADS geometry
  and the MACHLIM altitude inputs live in `st.form`s, and the live V-n / Mach-limit
  diagrams compute from an in-memory value (Flight Envelope uses a shallow-copy
  *probe* project carrying the effective input) without mutating the saved project.
  The SELECT (Critical Loads) tab now persists **only** `selected_case_ids`, and
  **only when it changed**, onto the stored critical set — instead of reassigning
  the whole recomputed object every render. Consequence (intended): visiting these
  pages no longer seeds downstream slices; the engineer clicks Apply once, and the
  existing downstream gates now correctly mean "hit Apply". New
  `tests/test_dirty_flag.py` drives both views via `AppTest` and asserts a
  no-interaction render leaves `project_to_dict` byte-for-byte unchanged for every
  example, plus that Apply *does* persist. No calc/oracle/schema change (438 tests
  green).

- **Loads Plots page now recomputes from the project (M2-1).** The Load-case
  plotting page read `Project.loads`, a result slice **no code path ever
  constructs** — so it was permanently empty behind an unsatisfiable "visit the
  Analysis pages first" message. It now recomputes the wing/fuselage/tail/
  control-surface distributions live from the inputs (`build_net_loads`,
  `build_body_loads`, `build_tail_chordwise`, `build_aileron`/`build_flap`/
  `build_tabs`) behind the same defensive wrapper the Export page uses, so the two
  pages can never diverge. Removed the matching dead `if project.loads is not
  None:` write-backs from the five Analysis views (fuselage/tail/aileron/flap/tab
  loads). GUI-only; no calc change (422 tests green).

- **Flap slipstream now uses takeoff power, not max-continuous (M1-9).**
  `flap._engine_power` preferred `max_cont_hp`; FAR 23.457(b) sizes the flaps-
  extended slipstream on **takeoff power** (Ref 1 p109; FAA User's Guide p14-2).
  The MAXHP preference is flipped to `takeoff_hp` (falling back to `max_cont_hp`
  only when takeoff power is unset), so the GA6 example pipeline now feeds 285 hp
  instead of 265. The Appendix A "Critical Flap Loads" oracle passes `maxhp=250`
  directly and is unaffected; the manual's 250 hp is a confirmed stale figure that
  matches neither GA6 engine rating. Docstring + `PROGRAM_SPEC.md`/theory-doc notes
  cite 23.457(b).

- **Ballast station rejected when it falls outside the fuselage (M1-11).**
  `weight_envelope`'s forward-regardless reference is selected by weight only, so on
  synthetic over-gross concept databases whose forward-loading vertices all sit
  *aft* of the forward-regardless limit the moment balance could land the ballast at
  a nonphysical station (e.g. `dhc8_dash8` → −112 in, forward of the nose datum).
  Every computed ballast station is now gated against a physical fore/aft fuselage
  station extent — an explicit `envelope.fuselage_nose_x`/`fuselage_tail_x` override,
  else the Step G1 fuselage outline, else the station-0 datum with an unbounded tail
  (only a station *ahead of the nose* is rejected). A station outside the extent
  emits the same `"(none — <reason>)"` marker as M1-7's other degeneracies. GA6
  oracle (158 lb @ 71.08) and the physical concept stations (`atr42_100` +112,
  `concept_regional_jet` +64, inside its [0, 1056] outline) are unchanged. Adds
  optional `fuselage_nose_x`/`fuselage_tail_x` to `WeightEnvelopeInput`. Datum-,
  outline-, and explicit-extent-branch tests in `test_weight_envelope.py`.

- **Aft-gross ballast reference no longer collapses to zero on over-gross
  loadings (M1-7, review T8).** `weight_envelope` used the *full* discretionary
  loading as the aft-gross ballast reference; when that full loading exceeded gross
  weight (`WB = gross − max_load < 0`) the case silently reported **0 lb ballast**
  — the twin/concept databases (`concept_regional_jet`, `atr42_100`). The aft-gross
  reference is now the **heaviest loading not exceeding gross** (mirroring the
  forward-regardless selection): unchanged on the GA6 (max load 3322 < gross 3400 →
  78 lb @ 108.4, oracle intact) but correct on over-gross databases. Degenerate
  references — an empty candidate set, a loading already at/above the target weight,
  or a heaviest ≤-gross loading already at/aft of the aft-CG limit — now emit an
  explicit `"(none — <reason>)"` marker row instead of silently dropping the
  structural point or printing a nonphysical moment-balance station. The manual's
  hand-rounded 103.7 aft-gross station stays a documented deviation (exact balance
  108.4 retained). Over-gross regression + marker tests in `test_weight_envelope.py`.

- **VC/VD speed coefficients clamp at W/S = 100 (M1-6, review T9).** The FAR
  23.335(a)/(b) minimum-speed coefficients Kc/Kd are tabulated only to a wing
  loading of 100 lb/ft² (Kc → 28.6, Kd → 1.35). `constants.cruise_speed_coefficient`
  / `dive_ratio_coefficient` kept extrapolating the W/S = 20→100 taper *below* those
  endpoints past 100, understating VC(min)/VD(min) — inert for GA (W/S ≈ 20) but
  non-conservative for the heavy-concept band this tool targets. Both coefficients
  now hold constant at 28.6 / 1.35 for W/S ≥ 100 (matching STRSPEED.BAS, which clamps
  there); the clamp is continuous (the taper reaches the endpoint exactly at 100).
  For W/S > 100 — outside 23.335's tabulated range — `structural_speeds` attaches an
  OUT-OF-BAND note to the design-speeds condition, flagging VC(min)/VD(min) as
  GA-extrapolated advisories and pointing to chosen VC/VD (warn-only, mirroring the
  P1-5 pattern). Boundary + note tests in `test_structural_speeds.py`.

- **One-engine-out 23.367(a)(2) case no longer double-factored (M1-5, review T7).**
  The VC (ultimate) condition carried the default safety factor 1.5 even though
  23.367(a)(2) loads are *defined as ultimate*, so the render/export layer multiplied
  an already-ultimate load by 1.5. The safety factor is now owned by the **load-case
  definition** — set by how the regulation *classifies* the load (LIMIT vs ULTIMATE),
  not by the speed — and each case definition also fixes the **speed range** it is
  considered over (evaluated at the critical high end). Being a *failure* case does
  not by itself reduce the factor. 23.367(a) (turbopropeller; Ref 1 Ch 11 p87;
  VMC = minimum control speed) defines two cases: **(a)(1)** fuel-flow interruption,
  **LIMIT → SF 1.5**, considered VMC→VD (a failure that keeps the full factor);
  **(a)(2)** compressor-from-turbine disconnection / turbine-blade loss,
  **ULTIMATE → SF 1.0**, considered VMC→VC ("limit treated as ultimate"). The VS
  point (VS substituted for VMC per the Ch 11 Method) is a **LIMIT → SF 1.5** design
  point. Each case declares its `load_class`/`safety_factor`, speed range and basis
  as a row in the `_load_cases` table (new `_LoadCase` NamedTuple), carried onto each
  `ConditionResult` (`safety_factor` + `note`), so the VC deliverable now renders
  `lbs-ULT` at `SF=1.0` instead of `SF=1.5`. Three tests added
  (`test_safety_factors_by_failure_mode`, `test_load_case_owns_sf_and_speed_range`,
  `test_rendered_loads_are_ultimate_with_correct_sf`). Not an oracle change (no
  printed ONENGOUT oracle exists; the factor is applied only at the render/export
  boundary).

- **AIRLOAD4 swept-wing renormalization restored (M1-3, review T4 — `[Major]`).**
  The swept-branch span-load correction subtracted the Pope & Haney sweepback term
  but omitted AIRLOAD4.BAS's `COL20 = COL19/CLCOL19` renormalization, so a swept
  concept wing's span load integrated to **less** than the operating CL — the
  shipped `concept_regional_jet` flagship (Λ=24°) lost **9.6%** of its lift
  (`recovered_cl` 0.452 vs target 0.50; 6–13% across Λ=20–30°), non-conservative and
  flowing into the `net_loads` → sbeam FORCE/MOMENT export. `airloads._apply_sweep`
  is replaced by `_sweep_operating`, which applies the Pope subtraction **and** the
  renormalization to the **combined operating** distribution (matching AIRLOAD4.BAS
  `COL16` — twist is redistributed too, not additive-only), at `target_cl` for the
  report/closure path and per-condition at each case's CL for the deliverable path.
  Renormalization uses the physically-correct span-load integral (the literal
  chord-weighted `CLCOL19` line is OCR-garbled and closes only to ~0.3%; span-load
  form closes exactly — Decision 3). `recovered_cl` on the flagship now recovers
  0.500; the unswept GA Appendix-A additive and the Λ=0 reduction invariant are
  unchanged. Guarded by a Λ≠0 closure test, a listing-traceable COL18/COL19/COL20
  reconstruction, and a deliverable per-case CL-recovery test.

- **`BAL 1.4VSF` balances at the 1-g flaps-down stall (M1-2, review T2 — `[Critical]`).**
  In the flaps-extended envelope corner set, `flight_envelope._flap_config_points`
  captured the **STALL 2G** speed and ran the `BAL 1.4VSF` balancing point at 1.4×
  that. `FLTLOADS.BAS` (Code.pdf p300–302) saves the **STALL 1GL** (1-g flaps-down
  stall) speed for this condition; since STALL 2G ≈ √2 × STALL 1G, the balance speed
  was ~1.4× too high and the balancing tail load (∝ V²) ~2.2× too large, feeding the
  SELECT search and sbeam export. Fixed to balance at 1.4× the STALL 1GL speed. On
  Appendix A p181 (LANDING CG5, case 89 `BAL 1.4VS`) the corrected point is V 83.6 kt
  / LT −430 lb; the defect produced ~116 kt / −957 lb. The real landing-config aero
  polynomials (Appendix A p179 input listing) are now transcribed into the
  `flight_envelope` test fixture — correcting the 0.2.0 baseline note that the repo
  lacked them — and the new `test_bal_1p4vsf_balances_at_one_g_flaps_down_stall`
  asserts both the exact fix invariant and the p181 oracle. The shipped
  `examples/ga6_normal.project.json` is unchanged (it carries no `flaps_down` set),
  so no existing envelope/SELECT/export result moved; activating the full
  flaps-extended SELECT→TAILDIST pipeline in the example stays with L-2.

- **VD floor now enforces `K_d·VCmin` (M1-1, review T1 — `[Critical]`).**
  `structural_speeds.py` computed the K_d dive-speed term as `K_d·VC` and reported
  it only as a "recommended" advisory, so on the **no-chosen-speeds** path VD fell
  to the `1.25·VC` floor. FAR 23.335(b) and `STRSPEED.BAS` (`V2DMIN=K2·V1CMIN`,
  lines 380/390) require **both** minimums with the K_d term on the *minimum* cruise
  speed: `VD ≥ max(K_d·VCmin, 1.25·VC)`. On the Appendix A Cat-N no-chosen-speeds
  case (p155) the corrected VD is **198.53 kt**; the prior code returned 177.26 —
  10.7% non-conservative, propagating into MD/MACHLIM and every case at VD. The
  chosen-speeds worked example (p156, VD 212.5) clears both floors and is unchanged.
  Concept mode (Cat C) keeps only the absolute 1.25·VC floor and reports K_d·VCmin
  as advisory (behavior unchanged). Reported `LoadValue` renamed
  "Recommended dive VD (gust, K*VC)" → **"Minimum dive VD(min)"** (the enforced
  floor). New oracle `test_vd_floor_no_chosen_speeds` (p155).

- **FAR-citation labels corrected (found via the FAA User's Guide review).**
  `WTONECG` (`weight_onecg.py`) cited `23.21/23.23` (proof-of-compliance + load
  distribution); changed to **`23.23/23.29`** — load-distribution limits and empty
  weight & corresponding CG, the quantities the module actually computes (User's
  Guide §4.3). `FLTLOADS` (`flight_envelope.py`) `_FAR` omitted **23.345**
  (high-lift devices) despite building the oracle-tested flaps-down envelope; now
  `23.333/23.337/23.341/23.345/23.421`. Labels only — no load value changes. (The
  SELECT v-tail side-gust `23.443(b)` was reviewed and deliberately kept: the
  McMaster `SELECT.BAS` grounds the gust-load formula in (b).)

- **TAILDIST mis-cited every chordwise tail condition as `23.421` (found via the
  FAA User's Guide review).** `taildist.run` hardcoded `far_reference="23.421"`
  (balancing loads) on every emitted `ConditionResult`, so the v-tail distributions
  (23.441/23.443) and the h-tail maneuver/gust/unsymmetrical rows (23.423/425/427)
  were all reported as "23.421 Balancing Loads." The correct citation was already on
  the source SELECT `CriticalCondition.far_reference` but was discarded because
  `TailChordResult` did not carry it. `TailChordResult` gains a `far_reference` field
  (populated verbatim from the governing condition, serialized by `io`), and
  `taildist.run` now cites `r.far_reference or "23.421"`. Load magnitudes are
  unchanged (citation-only). Regression: `test_far_reference_propagates_from_select`
  in `tests/test_taildist.py`. Additive field, defaulted `""`; older projects load
  unchanged. Source: FAA User's Guide §20.2.2/20.2.3 (DOT/FAA/AR-96/46).

- **Swept-wing aero fields dropped by the JSON round-trip (found via Step P1-1).**
  `AeroSurfaceInput.sweep_deg` / `design_mach` (the fields that auto-select the
  swept/high-Mach `AIRLOAD4` branch, added in Step C7) were never serialized by
  `io._aero_surface_from_dict` / `aero_to_dict`, so a swept wing loaded from disk
  silently reverted to the low-speed Schrenk path. No GA fixture set these fields,
  so the gap was invisible until the swept `concept_regional_jet` fixture. Both
  directions now carry them; additive and defaulted (0.0), so every existing project
  loads unchanged. Regression: `tests/test_concept_regional_jet.py`.

- **Weight Estimate page crashed on beyond-GA projects.** The Mission-inputs form
  hard-capped its widgets at GA-tier limits (`max_value = 3000 hp`, 12 seats, 6
  engines, 10 hr) while seeding each widget from the loaded project, so opening a
  project whose value exceeded a cap raised `StreamlitValueAboveMaxError` before
  the page could render (e.g. `examples/dhc8_dash8.project.json` at 4000 hp / 39
  seats). The hard `max_value` caps are removed (keeping `min_value` for physical
  sanity), consistent with the concept-aware superset that must accept airplanes
  beyond the GA band (`GUI_design.md §9` — warn, don't block). Regression:
  `tests/test_views_smoke.py::test_weight_estimate_accepts_beyond_ga_power` loads
  the DHC-8 into the page and asserts no exception.

- **GUI input widgets ignored the Imperial/SI toggle.** The global unit toggle
  (`app/Home.py`, `st.session_state["unit_system"]`) governed *results*
  everywhere but not *inputs* — every sidebar form and `data_editor` accepted
  and displayed Imperial regardless of the setting, so an SI user's entries were
  stored as Imperial. All remaining pages with domain inputs now follow the
  `engine_mount.py` pattern: seed via `farloads.units.to_display`, unit-suffixed
  labels, widget `key`s suffixed with `system.value` (re-seed on toggle), and
  `to_imperial_scalar` back to canonical Imperial on Apply (`configuration_
  layout`, `structural_speeds`, `wing_geometry`, `weight_cg_inertia`,
  `aileron_loads`, `flap_loads`, `flight_envelope`, `fuselage_loads`,
  `landing_loads`, `mach_limit`, `payload_cases`, `tab_loads`, `tail_loads`,
  `weight_envelope`, `weight_estimate`, `wing_loads`). `loads_plots.py`, which
  never referenced the toggle, gained display-only conversion of its plotted
  values and axis labels. `farloads/units.py`'s scalar kind tables gained
  `area_sqft`/`length_ft`/`inertia_lbin2`/`area_sqin`. Airspeed (KEAS) and
  altitude (ft) stay aviation-standard in both systems. Display/boundary only —
  `project.json` and the calc core stay Imperial, `SCHEMA_VERSION` unchanged at
  20; 303 tests pass.

- **`project.weight` merge-write dropped `envelope`.** `configuration_layout.
  py`'s station-seed button and both `project.weight` writes in
  `weight_estimate.py`/`weight_cg_inertia.py` rebuilt `WeightInput` without
  carrying forward `.envelope`, silently discarding the Weight Envelope
  page's inputs on the next save from any of those three pages. Found while
  verifying the Phase D Step D4 regression DoD item; all three now pass
  `envelope=project.weight.envelope` through.

### Documentation

- **Pre-release doc-currency sweep (0.3.0 gate, `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §3.1).**
  Fixed the schema-version drift the M2R-2 landing-purity change left behind: the
  `31 → 32` bump was recorded in the changelog but never propagated, so
  `GUI_design.md` ("currently `SCHEMA_VERSION = 31`", plus the migration-history
  list, now carrying `v32 M2R-2 LandingInput.n write-back removed`) and the
  `PROGRAM_SPEC.md` schema-version trail both read one version stale — a
  recurrence of the 2026-07-21 review's sole `[CRITICAL]`. Recorded the
  `body_loads` moment-closure limitation in `PROGRAM_SPEC.md` (Validation) and
  `20_theory/00_theory_sources.md` (both the module row and the closure-check
  table row, which claimed a free-free build without qualifying it to ΣFz).
  Refreshed the backlog "Current state" header (2026-07-21 → 2026-07-23, 466 →
  **483** passed, smoke test PASS, M2R + M3-1 noted closed) and marked the M4-1
  caveat-note obligation discharged.

- **Non-affiliation & attribution notice (M2R-2).** Added a non-affiliation
  statement to the README Disclaimer and an app-wide **About** section in the GUI
  sidebar (built once in `app/Home.py`, shown on every page): a modern **open
  replication** of the FAR23 loads suite (DOT/FAA/AR-96/46; Hal C. McMaster's CAE
  theory manual), **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with
  McGettrick Structural Engineering, Inc. or DARcorporation**, whose "FAR 23
  LOADS" is a separate commercial product. Legal-exposure mitigation, decoupled
  from the M3-1 rename.
- **Doc currency sweep (M2R-1).** Retired stale/contradictory statements the
  2026-07-21 review flagged (1 CRITICAL + 3 MAJOR). (a) `GUI_design.md`: replaced
  the baked `SCHEMA_VERSION = 28` line with a pointer to the generated
  `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` (currently v31) so it can no longer drift. (b) `CLAUDE.md`:
  retired the "Appendix A/B ±0.1% oracle-lock" claim (Appendix B is not in the
  bundled scan) → "Appendix A ±0.1%; twin cases closure-locked", linking the
  Oracle-status anchor in `00_theory_sources.md`. The "Appendix A **and/or** B"
  per-module test convention and the frozen history record are correct and left
  as-is. (c) `PROGRAM_SPEC.md`: filled the schema-version trail — inserted v29
  (single-source CLmax stall, M1-1b), appended v31 (M2-10 operational placards).
  (d) `00_INDEX.md`: added rows for `01_far25_gap_analysis.md` and
  `01_verification_baseline_0.2.0.md`, enumerated the `reference/` CFR/AC text
  extracts, and replaced the stale "two-phase plan" backlog description with the
  M2R→M3→M4→F25 milestone structure; corrections-register pointer `CLAUDE.md` →
  `02_approved_corrections.md` in both `00_theory_sources.md` and
  `PROGRAM_SPEC.md`; README examples line → all six fixtures (added `atr42_100`,
  `concept_regional_jet`).
- **Documentation consistency sweep (M1-10).** (a) Corrected the stale reference
  filenames across 8 docs — `FAR23 loads (1).pdf` → `FAR23Loads_Code.pdf`,
  `ADA324952.pdf` → `FAR23Loads_UserGuide.pdf` (the dated `PROJECT_REVIEW` finding is
  left verbatim as it describes the mapping). (b) Stopped baking `SCHEMA_VERSION 15`/
  `242 tests` into README prose (points at CI + this changelog) and replaced the
  stale "4-phase Define→Analyze→Review→Export" nav description in README/CLAUDE.md
  with the real 7 workflow phases. (c) Added a canonical **Oracle status** section to
  `docs/20_theory/00_theory_sources.md` (Appendix A oracle-locked; Appendix B absent
  from the bundled scan → twin/turboprop cases closure-locked) and pointed
  README/PROGRAM_SPEC at it, retiring the contradictory "every module is
  Appendix-checked" claim. (d) Moved the approved-corrections **register of record**
  from `CLAUDE.md` to `docs/20_theory/02_approved_corrections.md` (CLAUDE.md keeps the
  policy + link) and added the FAA User's Guide §17.2.1 corroboration to
  `engine_loads.md`.

- **Phase G — detailed plan for G0/G1 + canonical-units decision.** Locked the
  G-1 canonical display units (length → `in`/`mm`, area → `ft²`/`m²`) in
  `docs/30_future/03_gui_rework_plan.md` §2, and expanded `00_backlog.md` → Phase G
  steps **G0** (units collapse: retire the redundant `length_ft`/`area_sqin` kinds
  in `units.py`, remap `_PROJECT_FIELD_KIND`, sweep the views — display-only, no
  oracle change) and **G1** (geometry single-source-of-truth: consolidate
  `configuration_layout` + `wing_geometry`, add the fuselage as a geometry entity
  with schema bump, downstream read-through) with file-level scope, guardrails and
  sequencing. Docs only — no code, calc, or schema change.

- **Phase G — workflow-aligned GUI rework plan.** Added
  `docs/30_future/03_gui_rework_plan.md` (renamed/expanded from the draft
  `fix_the_gui.md`): assessment of the redesign proposal against the shipped
  Phase D/E/F GUI, locked decisions G-1…G-4 (one-unit-per-dimension,
  single-source-of-truth geometry incl. the fuselage, re-entry vs. true-loss
  persistence, genuine analysis-flow re-sequencing), and the target six
  analysis-flow sections with their page mapping. Seeded the step-by-step plan
  into `00_backlog.md` → Phase G (Steps G0–G8) plus the split-out calc item 2-12
  (ground-case distributed fuselage loads + pressurization); indexed in
  `00_INDEX.md` and cross-linked from `GUI_design.md`. Docs only — no code, calc,
  or schema change.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added

- **`scripts/smoke_test.sh`** (release step R2, `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §3.5): a
  permanent, repeatable GUI/CLI smoke test. Starts `app/Home.py` headless,
  waits for `/_stcore/health`, checks the root page returns HTTP 200 with no
  traceback in the server log, then runs `farloads engine
  examples/ga6_normal.project.json -o out.csv` and checks the CSV header/row
  count. `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §3.5 now points at the script instead of manual
  steps. No calc or schema change.

### Fixed

- **Flight Envelope page no longer destroys unedited `flight_loads` data**
  (Phase D Step D0, release step R1). The page previously rebuilt
  `FlightLoadsInput` wholesale (`configurations=[cruise]`,
  `altitudes_ft=[altitude]`) on every rerun, so merely opening it deleted any
  flaps-down configuration or extra altitudes a loaded project carried.
  `FlightLoadsInput` gains a pure `merged()` method (`farloads/models.py`) that
  merges one page-edit into the existing slice — the edited altitude replaces
  `altitudes_ft[0]`, the edited configuration replaces its same-`flaps_down`
  peer (appended if none), and everything else is preserved — and
  `app/views/flight_envelope.py` persists through it. This is the first
  application of the Phase-D "Apply merges into the project slice" page
  convention (`docs/40_history/05_phase_d_gui_workflow_plan.md §5`). Regression tests in
  `tests/test_flight_envelope.py` load a slice with a flaps-down configuration
  and two altitudes through the persist path and assert both survive. No calc
  or schema change.

### Added

- **`docs/40_history/01_verification_baseline_0.2.0.md`** (release step R4,
  `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §4.4): the permanent regression-baseline record — one
  table per module (all 22 ported programs + `configuration`/`body_loads`)
  mapping each printed Appendix A/B figure the test suite locks against to
  its reference-page citation and tolerance, plus a dedicated section for the
  closure-locked modules (ONENGOUT, the LANDLOAD wheel table, swept AIRLOAD4,
  FAR 25 optional engine cases, `body_loads`, `configuration`, concept-mode
  closure) that have no printed oracle. Docs-only.

### Changed

- **`PROGRAM_SPEC.md` docs-drift fix** (release step R3, `RELEASE_PROCESS.md`
  §3.1): `body_loads` (shipped in Step C6) now has its own module-spec entry
  (it was previously only mentioned inside SELECT's write-up) and the
  cross-module field-ownership table gained the `fuselage_mass` row it reads.
  Docs-only; no code/schema change.
- **Per-module analysis pages now mark their on-screen LIMIT loads.** The
  `flap_loads`, `tab_loads`, `one_engine_out` and `balanced_tail_verification`
  Streamlit pages display the calc's LIMIT values (the oracle-traceable numbers);
  each now carries a caption stating the on-screen loads are LIMIT and that the
  CSV/FORCE-card downloads and Review/Export pages are ULTIMATE (= limit × 1.5), and
  a `LIMIT` marker on every load column/metric. The mandate was scoped accordingly
  (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/10_standard/00_program_overview.md`): **all deliverable load
  output is ULTIMATE**; a per-module analysis page may show explicitly-marked LIMIT
  oracle values as the sole exception.
- **The `ULT` marker is now part of the load's units string.** All rendered load
  output (the load-case CSV headers, the `results_to_rows` `Units` column, and the
  text reports) carries the marker inline — force `lbs-ULT`/`N-ULT`, moment
  `ft-lb-ULT`/`lb-in-ULT`/`Nm-ULT`, pressure `lb/in^2-ULT` — replacing the previous
  separate `ULT` suffix on the column header. `report.py` gains `_ult_units()`
  (keyed off the existing load-unit detection), so non-load quantities (weights,
  locations, inertias, dimensionless load factors) keep their plain units. The `SF`
  column is unchanged; a case held at ultimate is `SF=1.0`. Render tests
  (`test_report.py`) updated to the `-ULT` unit forms.
- **Documented the ULTIMATE-output convention as a mandatory standard.** Codified in
  `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/10_standard/00_program_overview.md`,
  `docs/10_standard/PROGRAM_SPEC.md`, `docs/10_standard/PROJECT_GUIDE.md §5`,
  `docs/20_theory/00_theory_sources.md` and `docs/30_future/01_concept_loads_plan.md`:
  **all load output SHALL be ultimate**, the `ULT` marker is **part of the load's
  units string** (`lbs-ULT`/`N-ULT`, `ft-lb-ULT`/`lb-in-ULT`/`Nm-ULT`,
  `lb/in^2-ULT`), **every load case states its safety factor** (default 1.5 per 14
  CFR 23.303; Part 25 equivalent 25.303), and a value already at ultimate is
  **`ULT SF=1.0`**.
- **Rendered/exported loads are now ULTIMATE (= limit × factor of safety).** The
  calc still emits LIMIT loads (oracle-locked to the manual), but `report.py` and
  `export/sbeam_bridge.py` now multiply the load quantities (forces/moments/
  pressures — never geometry, weights, inertias, or dimensionless load factors) by a
  per-case factor of safety to report ultimate = limit × 1.5 (14 CFR 25.303). New
  `constants.ULTIMATE_FACTOR = 1.5` and `ConditionResult.safety_factor` (default
  1.5); the field is per-case so a future 14 CFR 25.302 / Appendix K probability-
  based factor (1.0–1.5) can be assigned to a failure case — sudden engine stoppage
  is held at the conservative 1.5 for now. The load-case CSV gains an `SF` column and
  marks the force/moment headers `ULT`; the sbeam FORCE/MOMENT cards, span-load CSVs
  and closure comments are ultimate (the set still sums to 1.5 × the root/total).
  Reference: `reference/14CFR_factor_of_safety.md`. Calc oracle tests unchanged;
  render/export tests (`test_report.py`, `test_io.py`, `test_sbeam_bridge.py`) updated
  to ultimate.


- **GUI restructured into the four-phase workflow (Define → Analyze → Review →
  Export).** `app/Home.py` is now an `st.navigation` entry point that builds the
  phase-grouped sidebar from the new `farloads/workflow.py` — the ordered,
  dependency-aware step graph (each step names its calc `module` and the slices it
  `requires`/`produces`). The 20 page files moved `app/pages/NN_*.py` →
  `app/views/<workflow-key>.py` (clean names, no numeric prefixes; the duplicate
  `06_` index is gone), and each page's `set_page_config` was removed (called once,
  in `Home.py`, as `st.navigation` requires). The old Phase-0 Home page (which only
  inspected four of the ~20 project slices) is replaced by `views/dashboard.py`: an
  Overview that loads/saves the project and shows per-step completeness.

### Added (GUI)

- **Results Review & Export pages.** `views/results_review.py` consolidates the
  governing (critical) loads on every component plus all module results by phase;
  `views/export_report.py` gathers every output in one place — project JSON,
  per-module load CSVs + a combined text report, sbeam wing/fuselage/tail/
  control-surface BDF cards, and a single **Download all `.zip`** bundle. Both
  recompute from the project inputs, so exports are never stale. *(Closes the
  "Combined workbook export" backlog item.)*
- **GUI regression tests.** `tests/test_workflow.py` (step-graph well-formedness;
  every registered module has a workflow step) and `tests/test_views_smoke.py`
  (headless `AppTest` runs the entry point + all 20 views with the example project,
  asserting no uncaught exception). +24 tests.
- **Multi-engine engine-mount page.** `app/views/engine_mount.py` now exposes the
  first-class multi-engine `Project`: a sidebar **layout** selector (1 nose / 2 or
  4 wing-mounted engines) drives the engine count, and an **engine selector** picks
  which engine is being assessed. Each engine's inputs (type, CG, weights, rotors)
  are held canonically in Imperial in `st.session_state["engine_inputs"]` — keyed
  per engine and unit system — so switching engine or unit system preserves every
  engine's data. Results default to the selected engine with a **"Show all engines"**
  toggle for the full `engine.run(project)` (each condition prefixed with the engine
  designation); the JSON/CSV/text exports cover every engine. A single engine
  reduces exactly to the previous behaviour (no prefixes, identical to `run_all`).

### Fixed

- **Engine-mount page crash.** `app/views/engine_mount.py` still built its
  save-project payload with the removed single-engine `Project(engine=...)` keyword;
  now uses `engines=[...]` + `EngineLayout.SINGLE_NOSE`. Caught by the new view
  smoke test.

### Changed

- **Corrected FAR 23.361(a)(1) takeoff torque (AC 23-19A).** The takeoff-case engine
  mount torque is now `factor × mean takeoff torque` (the same cylinder/turboprop
  factor as (a)(2)), where the original program and McMaster's manual left it
  **unfactored**. Per **AC 23-19A**, the unfactored form is the **Amendment 23-26**
  drafting error (non-conservative, lower loads), corrected by **Amendment 23-45**:
  23.361(c) applies the factor to all of paragraph (a). For the IO-520-BB the
  takeoff mount torque changes 554.39 → **737.34 ft-lb**; for a turbopropeller it
  becomes 1.25× mean takeoff, identical to 25.361(a)(1)(i). This is a **user-approved,
  documented deviation from the Appendix A oracle** (CLAUDE.md "Approved corrections
  to the source"); `test_361_a1` asserts the corrected value and retains 554.39 as
  the mean-torque figure. Source text: `reference/AC_23-19A_engine_torque.md`.
- **Corrected FAR 23.361(a)(3) turboprop-malfunction torque (AC 23-19A).** The
  propeller-control-malfunction mount torque is now `1.6 × 1.25 × mean takeoff
  torque` (= 2.0× mean), where the original program (`TTP=1.6*ENGTORQ`) and
  McMaster's manual applied only the 1.6 factor. The (a)(3) base limit takeoff
  torque is the same quantity as (a)(1), so 23.361(c)'s 1.25 turbopropeller
  mean-torque factor applies before the 1.6 — the same **Amendment 23-26** omission
  / **Amendment 23-45** restoration as the (a)(1) correction above. A **user-approved,
  documented deviation** (CLAUDE.md "Approved corrections to the source"); no printed
  Appendix B engine-mount oracle exists, so it is formula-checked in
  `test_361_a3_applies_mean_torque_factor`. Source: `reference/AC_23-19A_engine_torque.md`.

### Added

- **Optional supplemental FAR 25 engine cases (concept superset).**
  `Project.include_far25` (default off) appends only the **non-duplicative**
  **14 CFR 25.361 / 25.371** engine-mount cases on top of the oracle-locked FAR 23
  set, for **turbopropeller** engines: (a)(3)(i) stoppage `@ 1g`, (a)(3)(ii)
  max-accel torque `@ 1g` (no FAR 23 analog), and 25.371 gyroscopic on the A2 limit
  load factor. The FAR 25 torque cases 25.361(a)(1)(i)/(ii)/(iii) are **omitted** —
  with the AC 23-19A correction factoring the FAR 23 takeoff case, they are
  bit-for-bit duplicates of the corrected 23.361(a)(1)/(a)(2)/(a)(3) for a
  turbopropeller. 25.371 reuses the fixed FAR 23.371(b) rates (2.5/1.0 rad/s) as a
  conservative concept stand-in for the maneuver-derived rates. New optional input
  `EngineInput.max_accel_torque` (blank → `max_engine_torque`); recip/jet engines get
  no FAR 25 cases. The engine-mount GUI gains an **"Add supplemental FAR 25 cases"**
  checkbox. Kept opt-in (not folded into the FAR 23 path) so the Appendix A/B oracle
  — 6 turboprop conditions, 2.5g gyro vertical — is byte-identical when off. Source
  text in `reference/14CFR_Part25_engine_torque.md`; formula-closure tested
  (`tests/test_engine_far25.py`). No oracle exists for Part 25.
- **Balanced-tail-load verification — BALLOADS (Step C11).** New
  `modules/balloads.py` (registers `"balloads"`): the off-pipeline cross-check of
  `BALLOADS.BAS` (Reference 1 Ch 8–9). For every flaps-retracted V-n condition it
  recomputes the rational balancing horizontal-tail load — AoA load at 25% tail MAC
  (`LT25`) + camber/elevator load at 50% (`LT50`), elevator deflection and elevator
  load — **reusing SELECT's oracle-locked `htail_balance`/`_elevator_load`** (no
  re-derivation), converts the rational CP (% tail MAC) to a fuselage station and
  reports it against FLTLOADS' *approximate* `XTC`/`XTF`. Verification report only —
  no schema change, no pipeline output. New `app/pages/16_Balanced_Tail_Verification.py`.
  Oracle-locked against the Ch 9 case-202 hand-calc (`LT = 519.845 lb`, LT25 +907.62,
  LT50 −387.78, δ −5.39°, CP 6.35% tail MAC); the rational up/down loads equal
  SELECT's `BAL UP/DN RETRACTED` exactly. 4 new tests (211 total). **This completes
  all 22 of Reference 1's Appendix-C programs.**
- **Landing / ground loads — LGFACTOR + LANDLOAD (Step C10).** New
  `modules/landing.py` (registers `"landing"`): the FAR Part 23 Subpart C
  ground-load conditions (Reference 1 Ch 20). **LGFACTOR** estimates the landing
  load factor from the FAR 23.473 drop-test work-energy balance (descent velocity
  `V = 4.4·(W/S)^0.25` clamped 7–10 fps, tyre/strut energy efficiencies → airplane
  load factor `N`, gear factor `NLG = N − L`). **LANDLOAD** computes the tricycle-gear
  reaction loads (24 main-wheel + 33 nose-wheel cases) for the level, tail-down,
  one-wheel, braked-roll, side and supplementary-nose-wheel conditions
  (FAR 23.473–23.499) — the drag factor `K`, ground angles, `BETA`, the `AP/BP/DP/CP`
  lever arms, per-wheel ground-line and airplane-datum reactions and the unbalanced
  moments. New `LandingInput`/`LandingGearInput` input slice (`Project.landing`,
  carrying the gear strut geometry that has no home in the aerodynamic
  `Project.geometry`) and `GearReactionCase` result record; `SCHEMA_VERSION` 14 → 15
  (additive). New `app/pages/15_Landing_Loads.py`. LGFACTOR is oracle-locked against
  Appendix A p236 (V 9.0048 / N 3.0951 / NLG 2.4281); LANDLOAD's gear-geometry
  intermediates are oracle-locked against p230, with the OCR-garbled printed
  wheel-load table closure- + legible-cell-validated (the ONENGOUT precedent). 9 new
  tests; **all 22 Reference 1 Appendix-C suite programs except the optional BALLOADS
  utility are now ported.**
- **One-engine-out vertical-tail loads — ONENGOUT (Step C9).** New
  `modules/one_engine_out.py` (registers `"one_engine_out"`): a time-marching yaw
  simulation of the FAR 23.367 critical-engine failure (Reference 1 Ch 11). The
  failed engine's thrust/windmill-drag asymmetry yaws the airplane about its
  vertical axis (`IZZ`) until the pilot — at peak yaw rate but ≥2 s after failure
  (23.367(b)) — applies full rudder and recovers; `run()` reports the maximum
  vertical-tail load per speed (VC ultimate / VD limit / VS) with engine thrust,
  windmill drag, max yaw rate, the 25%/50% MAC loads at peak and time to recovery,
  and `time_history()` returns the full transient on demand (below VMC the run is
  time-bounded and flagged non-recovered). New shared `modules/_vtail.py` (the v-tail
  lift slope AVT, rudder effectiveness EFFECTV and the large-deflection EF chart),
  with SELECT's private `_avt`/`_effectv`/`_ef` refactored to delegate to it. New
  `app/pages/20_One_Engine_Out.py` (per-speed summary + on-demand time-history
  charts/CSV). First module to exercise the first-class multi-engine `Project`.
  **Validation:** the printed Appendix B twin oracle is unavailable (Appendix B is
  absent from the bundled references), so C9 is locked by sub-formula exactness vs
  `ONENGOUT.BAS` + integration/physics closure + refactor-parity with SELECT (11 new
  tests; 198 pass).

- **Schema v14 (Step C9).** `Project.one_engine_out` (`OneEngineOutInput`) input
  slice and `VTailLoadsInput.xv50` (FS of 50% v-tail MAC) — additive; older files
  load unchanged.

- **Control-surface simplified distributions — AILERON / FLAPLOAD / TABLOADS (Step
  C8).** New `modules/aileron.py`, `modules/flap.py`, `modules/tab.py` (register
  `"aileron"` / `"flap"` / `"tab"`): the FAR-style simplified pressure
  distributions. **Aileron** (Ch 16, FAR 23.455 / CAM 3.222) — deflected up/down
  rolling loads over the VA/VC/VD schedule, constant LE→hinge then taper to 0 at
  the TE. **Flap** (Ch 17, FAR 23.345 / 23.457) — the four-condition flaps-extended
  envelope (Abbott & von Doenhoff Fig 98) with the momentum-theory propeller
  slipstream and the head-on 25 fps gust amplifications, taper LE→half at TE.
  **Tab** (Ch 18, FAR 23.409 / CAM 3.224) — full deflection at VC, trapezoidal
  (LE = 2× TE). New input slices `AileronLoadsInput` / `FlapLoadsInput` /
  `TabLoadsInput`(+`TabSpec`), the `ControlSurfaceLoadResult` slice on
  `LoadsResult.control_surface`, the `sbeam_bridge` control-surface export
  (`control_surface_csv` / `control_surface_force_moment_cards`, FORCE set scaled to
  the critical load), and `app/pages/12_Aileron_Loads.py` /
  `13_Flap_Loads.py` / `14_Tab_Loads.py`. `structural_speeds.design_speed_values()`
  exposes the scalar design speeds the modules read. Oracle-locked against the
  Appendix A reports (p200/p201/p202) within ±0.1%.

- **Schema v13 (Step C8).** `Project.aileron_loads` / `flap_loads` / `tab_loads`
  input slices and `LoadsResult.control_surface` — all additive; older files load
  unchanged.

- **Chordwise tail-load distribution — TAILDIST (Step C7).** New `modules/taildist.py`
  (registers `"taildist"`): the five-station chordwise net pressure profile on the
  average tail chord — the additive (angle-of-attack, 25% chord) plus camber (50%
  chord) distributions (TAILDIST.BAS subroutine 3000, Reference 1 Ch 10) — for each
  critical horizontal/vertical-tail condition from SELECT. SELECT now attaches the
  rational `lt25`/`lt50` split to every tail `CriticalCondition`. New
  `app/pages/11_Tail_Distribution.py`, the `sbeam_bridge` tail export
  (`tail_chordwise_csv` / `tail_force_moment_cards`) and the `cli.py`
  `--export-target tail` option. Oracle-locked against the Appendix A "Chordwise
  Distribution of Tail Loads" tables (13 horizontal p237 + 4 vertical p245) within
  ±0.1%.

- **Swept / high-Mach airloads — AIRLOAD4 (Step C7).** `modules/airloads.py` gains
  the AIRLOAD4 branch (Ref 1 Ch 12): the Pope & Haney sweepback redistribution of
  the additive Schrenk span load, auto-selected (`use_airload4`) when the 25%-chord
  sweep exceeds 15° or the design Mach exceeds 0.4, reducing exactly to AIRLOADS at
  zero sweep / low Mach. New `AeroSurfaceInput.sweep_deg` / `design_mach` triggers.

- **Schema v12 (Step C7).** `TailLoadsInput.htail_semispan_in`,
  `VTailLoadsInput.vtail_span_in`, `CriticalCondition.lt25`/`lt50`, the
  `TailChordResult` slice on `LoadsResult.tail_chordwise`, and the
  `AeroSurfaceInput` sweep fields — all additive; older files load unchanged.

- **Critical Loads + Fuselage Loads UI pages (Step C6, R9).** New Streamlit pages
  `app/pages/09_Critical_Loads.py` (the SELECT critical wing / h-tail / v-tail /
  fuselage conditions, grouped per component with their loads and FAR cites; persists
  `envelope.critical`) and `app/pages/10_Fuselage_Loads.py` (the Ch 15 fuselage net
  shear/bending per critical condition, editable fuselage mass distribution, closure
  metric, plots and CSV download). Both flag concept-mode results as unverified
  extrapolation.

- **Flaps-extended tail loads + flapped V-n envelope (Step C6, R3/R4).**
  `flight_envelope` gains the flaps-extended (LANDING) V-n corner set at the flap
  speed VF (FLTLOADS.BAS subroutine 3000: stall at 2/3 g / 1 g / 2 g, the n=2 / n=0
  maneuver points at VF, ± gusts at VF, and the VF / 1.4 Vs balancing points,
  n-limited to 2 per FAR 23.345 and investigated at sea level). SELECT extends the
  balancing search to the flaps-extended points (FAR 23.421) and adds the
  flaps-extended gust (FAR 23.425(a)(2), 25 fps at VF). The real landing-config aero
  polynomials are not in the repo fixtures, so R3/R4 are validated by **closure**
  (the flapped points achieve their target NZ; the rational balancing tail load
  zeroes the flapped pitching moment) rather than the printed flaps-extended oracle
  (Appendix A cases 81/106/88/108). `tests/test_flight_envelope.py` /
  `tests/test_select.py` extended.

- **Net fuselage loads + sbeam body export (Step C6, R6/R8).** New `body_loads`
  module (Ref 1 Ch 15) computes the fuselage longitudinal net distribution for each
  critical fuselage condition: each station's inertia (`-NZ·w`), the balancing tail
  air load at the tail station, and the wing reaction at 25% wing MAC, integrated
  nose→tail to running shear `Sz` and bending `Myy` → `Project.loads.body_net`
  (`BodyLoadResult`/`BodyStationLoad`) + a per-station CSV (`body_load_rows`). Ch 15
  ships no program/oracle, so it is validated by **equilibrium closure** (applied
  `ΣFz=0`, shear returns to 0 aft of the wing). The sbeam bridge gains
  `body_span_load_csv` / `body_force_moment_cards` (FORCE Fz per station, the set
  summing to ~0). New `tests/test_body_loads.py`.

- **WTONECG — persisted mass slice (Step C6, R7).** `weight_onecg.build_mass`
  emits the long-deferred `Project.mass` slice (`MassResult`): weight, CG and the
  airplane moments/product of inertia (lb-in²) about the CG for the itemized
  loading. Validated against Appendix A p136 and the io round-trip. SELECT's oracle
  searches keep their documented Ch 9 inertia approximations (so the slice is
  available for reporting/future per-CG work without changing the locked results).

- **SELECT — critical fuselage conditions (Step C6).** Adds the Ch 9 fuselage
  condition search (SELECT.BAS subroutine 4000): the maximum fuselage load reacted
  at the wing (`LZW − NZ·WW`, FAR 23.301), the aft-fuselage down/up bending (the
  largest signed product of that load and the tail load, 23.331), and the greatest
  vertical inertia factor for concentrated-weight installations (23.301). `WW`
  (wing weight) is a new `SelectInput` field (default `0.09·MTOW`). These are
  condition *selections* (scalar criticals) distinct from the Ch 15 fuselage net
  *distribution* (R6). Oracle-locked against Appendix A "Critical Fuselage Loads":
  max down load on wing 13347.6 (GUST +C), aft down bending 12569.6, aft up bending
  −6390.3 (GUST −C), greatest NZ 5.81. `tests/test_select.py` extended.

- **SELECT — horizontal-tail maneuver / gust / unsymmetrical loads (Step C6).**
  Extends the `select` module with the remaining flaps-retracted h-tail conditions:
  unchecked maneuver up/down (FAR 23.423(a) — full elevator deflection at the 1g VA
  points), checked maneuver up/down (23.423(b) — a pitch-acceleration increment
  `Iyy·θ̈/arm` with the approximate `Iyy=0.44·W·LF²/384` and `θ̈=39·n(n−1.5)/V` at
  VC/VD), up/down gust (23.425(a)(1) — the balancing load plus the rational gust
  increment `KG·Ude·V·ST·AHT·(1−36aw/ARW)/498`), and the unsymmetrical load
  (23.427(a) — 100% one side / `100−10(n−1)`% the other, excluding the locally
  carried unchecked-maneuver loads per FAA CAM 3.216). The large-deflection
  effectiveness factor `EF(δ, Se/St)` is reconstructed exactly from SELECT.BAS
  subroutine 10000. `TailLoadsInput` extended with the elevator geometry, airplane
  length and wing lift slope (`SCHEMA_VERSION` 10 → 11, additive). Oracle-locked
  against Appendix A "Critical Horizontal Tail Loads": unchecked −1397.8 / +1227.2,
  checked −671.5 / +787.8, gust +908.6 / −1292.8, unsymmetrical −1111.8 (RH −646.4,
  LH −465.4). `tests/test_select.py` extended.

- **SELECT — rational vertical-tail loads (Step C6).** Extends the `select` module
  with the four critical vertical-tail loads (Ch 9 / SELECT.BAS subroutine 8300),
  searched over the V-n `BAL A` (VA) and `BAL C` (VC) points: sudden full rudder
  deflection (FAR 23.441(a)(1)), yaw to a 19.5° sideslip with the rudder held
  (23.441(a)(2)), a 15° yaw with the rudder neutral (23.441(a)(3)), and the lateral
  gust at VC (23.443(b)). Side loads use the tail lift slope `AVT=2π/(1+2/ARVT)`,
  the rudder effectiveness `EFFECTV=cubic(SR/SV)`, and the gust mass-ratio /
  alleviation `UGT`/`KGT` with a default yaw inertia `IZZ`. New `VTailLoadsInput`
  slice (`Project.vtail_loads`); `SCHEMA_VERSION` 9 → 10 (additive) with the `io.py`
  round-trip. Oracle-locked against Appendix A "Critical Vertical Tail Loads" —
  yaw-15 −526, side gust +604 (IZZ 4169.2) and the angle-of-attack components are
  exact; the rudder-deflection loads (sudden rudder +591, rudder load 167) carry an
  `EFV≈1.009` large-deflection chart factor that is illegible in the scanned source
  (a `VTailLoadsInput` field, default 1.0). `tests/test_select.py` extended.
  Vertical-tail `CriticalCondition`s land alongside the wing and htail sets in
  `Project.envelope.critical`.

- **SELECT — rational horizontal-tail balancing loads (Step C6).** Extends the
  `select` module with the Ch 9 / BALLOADS rational balancing method: for every
  balanced V-n point it resolves the total balanced tail load into the
  angle-of-attack load at 25% tail MAC (`LT25=(AT·AHT/57.3)·Q·ST`, tail AoA
  `AT=αwl+IT−E`, downwash `E=114.6·CL/(π·ARW)`, slope `AHT=2π/(1+2/ARHT)`) and the
  camber/elevator load at 50% MAC (`LT50` from balancing the pitching moment about
  the CG for the elevator deflection), then selects the largest up and largest down
  balancing load with flaps retracted (FAR 23.421) into `Project.envelope.critical`
  as `htail` `CriticalCondition`s. New `TailLoadsInput` slice (`Project.tail_loads`:
  tail incidence, wing/tail aspect ratios, tail area, elevator effectiveness, 25%/50%
  tail-MAC stations, wing zero-lift angles); `SCHEMA_VERSION` 8 → 9 (additive) with
  the `io.py` round-trip. Oracle-locked against the Ch 9 case-202 hand-calc
  (LT25 +907.62, LT50 −387.78, δ −5.39°, **LT 519.845**, CP 6.35%) and Appendix A
  "Critical Horizontal Tail Loads" (UP STALL +N CG1 18000 +519.85, DOWN MAN D CG3
  12000 −613.92). The H-tail maneuver/gust/unsymmetrical, the flaps-extended
  balancing (needs the flapped V-n envelope), the vertical tail and the fuselage net
  are still later C6 increments. `tests/test_select.py` extended.

- **SELECT — critical wing loads (Step C6).** New registered `select` module
  (`farloads/modules/select.py`) porting SELECT.BAS's wing critical-load search
  (Ref 1 Ch 9, SELECT.BAS ~2990-3540): it scans the balanced FLTLOADS V-n matrix
  for the governing wing condition of each design point — **PHAA**/**PLAA**
  (largest resultant `√(LZW²+DX²)`), **PMAA** (largest LZW), **NMAA** (largest
  negative resultant), **ACRL** (accelerated roll), and **TORS** (steady-roll
  aileron torsion `(cm−0.01·δ)·G·V²`, deflection per CAM 3.222) — and writes them
  as wing `CriticalCondition`s into `Project.envelope.critical`. New `SelectInput`
  slice (`Project.select_input`: full-down aileron deflection + basic-airfoil cm
  for the steady-roll search); `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped 7 → 8 (additive) with the
  `io.py` round-trip. Oracle-locked against Appendix A "Critical Wing Loads" (PHAA
  STALL +N CL +1.519/V 117.40, PLAA MAN D +0.472/212.40, PMAA GUST +C +0.810/170,
  NMAA GUST −C −0.433/170, ACRL AC ROLL +1.328/116, TORS ST ROL C +0.470/170);
  `tests/test_select.py`. The rational horizontal/vertical-tail and fuselage
  critical loads (rest of Ch 9) and the fuselage net distribution are a later C6
  increment; `select` joins the `run_all_modules` set.

- **C6 schema foundation (SELECT + fuselage/body loads).** First step of Step C6:
  the `Project` schema additions the SELECT module and fuselage net distribution
  build on, all additive (`SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped 6 → 7; older files load
  unchanged). New `Project.mass` slice (`MassResult`/`MassCase`: persisted WTONECG
  weight/CG/inertia per loading) — the long-deferred persisted mass slice, landed
  now that SELECT needs the inertia. New `Project.fuselage_mass` input slice
  (`FuselageMassInput`/`FuselageStation`: the fuselage longitudinal mass
  distribution for the body net loads). New SELECT critical-load set
  (`CriticalLoadSet`/`CriticalCondition`) on `EnvelopeResult.critical` (previously
  reserved). New fuselage net distribution (`BodyLoadResult`/`BodyStationLoad`) on
  `LoadsResult.body_net`, the body analogue of `wing_net`. Full `io.py` JSON
  round-trip for every new slice; the new types are re-exported from `farloads`.
  Validated by `tests/test_io.py::test_c6_slices_round_trip`.

- **Configuration & Layout page + fleet assessment (Step C5).** New
  `Project.configuration` slice (`LayoutInput`: fuselage, parametric wing, tail
  areas/arms, landing gear) and a registered `configuration` calc module that
  derives the wing planform (MAC/XLEMAC/Y_MAC/AR/span via the WINGGEOM strip
  integrator on generated polylines), a tail-volume neutral point + static margin,
  tip-back / overturn angles and prop ground clearance. New Streamlit page
  `app/pages/00_Configuration_Layout.py` (Plotly three-view with CG/NP markers,
  assessment panel, a WINGGEOM seed button, and W/S-vs-W/P + MTOW-vs-OEW fleet
  plots). `app/data/reference_aircraft.csv` extended with a heavier/concept tier
  (twin pistons, commuters, a bizjet, light transports). Modern addition — no
  `.BAS` and **no regression oracle**; figures are first-order estimates flagged in
  concept mode. `SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped 5 → 6 (additive). Validated by
  analytic-vs-WINGGEOM-strip MAC consistency (±0.1%) and Appendix A trapezoid
  plausibility (±10%).

- **sbeam export bridge (Step C4).** New `farloads/export/` subpackage turns the
  NETLOADS net wing load (`Project.loads.wing_net`) into sbeam-consumable
  artifacts: a **span-load CSV**, **FORCE/MOMENT** bulk-data cards (comma
  free-field unit-scale form matching `sbeam/results/load_export.py`, one load set
  per case), and an optional minimal **CBAR stick-model BDF** (GRID + CBAR chain +
  PBAR/MAT1 placeholder + root SPC1 + a SOL 101 subcase per case). The applied
  nodal load at each station is the *increment of the cumulative* NETLOADS column,
  so the FORCE set sums to the root shear and the MOMENT(My) set to the root
  torsion exactly (and the FORCE moments reproduce the root bending). Coordinate
  map (`export/coordinates.py`) is FAR23LOADS station/butt/waterline inches →
  sbeam global CID 0 (identity, single edit-point). New CLI flag
  `--export-sbeam <prefix> [--stick-model]`. The bridge is a pure renderer, not a
  registered calc module. Validated by force/moment closure + a self-contained
  free-field round-trip; the stick deck parses **and solves SOL 101** in the real
  sbeam (manual verification).

- **Net wing loads — WINGINER + NETLOADS (Step C3).** New `wing_inertia` and
  `net_loads` modules compute the spanwise wing **shear, bending moment and
  torsion** along the 25% chord as the algebraic sum of the air loads and the
  inertia loads — the headline structural deliverable (root values size the wing).
  `AIRLOADS` is extended with an air-load distribution (`air_load_distribution`):
  it scales the C1 Schrenk lift to the operating CL, builds per-strip
  lift/drag/pitching-moment forces, rotates them into the airplane reference and
  integrates to the cumulative shears/moments/torsion (drag = computed induced +
  input profile). `WINGINER` models the wing-panel mass as a linearly-tapered area
  density (root density iterated to the panel weight) plus concentrated weights,
  forming 1g-vertical / 1g-drag / unit-roll cases combined per condition.
  `NETLOADS` sums air + inertia per station. Adds a `Project.wing_mass` input slice
  (`WingMassInput`/`ConcentratedWeight`/`WingLoadCase`) and a `Project.loads`
  result slice (`LoadsResult`/`WingLoadResult`/`WingStationLoad`), with section
  `profile_drag`/`section_cm` added to `AeroSurfaceInput`; schema bumped to **v5**
  (additive). New Streamlit page `app/pages/08_Net_Wing_Loads.py` (air/inertia/net
  shear-BM-torsion plots + CSV). FAR23 oracle-locked against the Appendix A air-load
  (p206), wing-inertia (p217-221) and net-load (p222) tables; the critical
  conditions come from the FLTLOADS V-n matrix (the C3-before-SELECT bridge).

- **Flight envelope + balancing tail loads — FLTLOADS (Step C2).** New
  `flight_envelope` module (`farloads/modules/flight_envelope.py`) builds the
  FAR 23.333 maneuver + gust **V-n diagram** and the **balancing horizontal-tail
  load** at every cruise corner — a faithful port of FLTLOADS.BAS subroutine 3900
  (iterate angle of attack to the required load factor, then dynamic pressure to
  the Mach-adjusted stall line; Glauert compressibility; CLmax-vs-Mach curve) and
  4864 (gust load factor, FAR 23.341). Reads the design speeds and limit load
  factors from STRSPEED. Adds a `Project.flight_loads` input slice
  (`FlightLoadsInput`/`AeroCoeffSet`/`CgCase`: geometry scalars, airplane-less-tail
  aero-coefficient polynomials, weight-CG cases) and a `Project.envelope` result
  slice (`EnvelopeResult`/`VnPoint`/`TailBalanceLoad`) with `io.py` round-trip;
  schema bumped to **v4** (additive — older files load unchanged). New Streamlit
  page `app/pages/07_Flight_Envelope.py` (V-n chart + balanced-condition table).
  The GA and concept example fixtures gain a `flight_loads` slice. FAR23
  oracle-locked against the Appendix A "V-n Data" cruise matrix (p179-180); concept
  mode validated by physics closure (attains the user load factor; LZ+LT = NZ·W).

- **Spanwise wing airloads — AIRLOADS + TAU (Step C1).** New `airloads` module
  (`farloads/modules/airloads.py`) computes the wing spanwise lift distribution by
  **Schrenk's method** (Reference 1 Ch 7): the additive distribution (untwisted
  wing at CL=1), the twist-driven basic distribution, and their combination at a
  target CL — the `c·cl` span load every downstream wing-load module consumes. Folds
  in the **TAU** lift-curve-slope planform correction (`TAU.BAS` curve-fit, p407).
  Adds a `Project.aero` slice (`AeroInput`/`AeroSurfaceInput`: section lift-curve
  slope, taper/tip ratio, twist table, target CL) with `io.py` round-trip; schema
  bumped to v3 (additive — older files load unchanged). New Streamlit page
  `app/pages/06_Airloads.py` with a span-load plot (additive / basic / total) and
  the integrated-CL closure check. The GA and concept example fixtures gain an
  `aero` wing slice. FAR23 oracle-locked: the additive (`CC(LA1)`/`C(LA1)`) and
  basic (`Awo`/`CC(lb)`/`Clb`) distributions match Appendix A p161-162 within ±0.1%;
  concept mode is validated by physics closure (integrated `∫c·cl dy` recovers the
  target CL; basic distribution carries zero net wing lift). Known limitation: the
  cosine fairing of the basic distribution across a flap/aileron discontinuity is
  not yet modelled (arises only with deflected flaps).

- **Concept mode (Step C0) — foundation for >12,500 lb configurations.** Adds a
  `"C"` (concept) certification category to `StructuralSpeedsInput`: STRSPEED
  bypasses the GA-only FAR 23.337 maneuver-load-factor formula and cap, instead
  using the user's `chosen_n`/`chosen_nneg` verbatim (both now required in concept
  mode). Adds a **direct-weight path** (`WeightInput.direct_totals()`) that derives
  MTOW/OEW/useful by summing the itemized `MassItem` data base by kind, replacing
  WTESTIMA's GA regression for a heavy concept; WTESTIMA still runs but flags itself
  as a sanity-only estimate (`Project.is_concept` is the single concept read-point).
  Schema bumped to v2 (additive — v1 files load unchanged). The Structural Speeds
  page gains the Concept category with `n`/`n_neg` inputs and an unverified-
  extrapolation warning; the Weight Estimate page shows a concept sanity banner.
  Example fixture `examples/concept_heavy.project.json` (MTOW 18,000 lb). The FAR23
  path stays oracle-locked: all Appendix-A/B tests pass unchanged, and concept mode
  reduces exactly to FAR23 on GA inputs. Confirmed no hard ≤12,500 lb / seat-count
  assertion was load-bearing.

- **Phase C — initial-concept loads tool plan** — adopted a development plan that
  grows the suite from a ≤12,500 lb FAR Part 23 replication into an
  initial-concept distributed-loads tool: a `concept` mode that generalizes the
  FAR23 weight/seat/load-factor caps, configuration assessment against similar
  airplanes, per-component distributed loads (wing / body / tail + standard
  simplified control-surface distributions), and a `FORCE`/`MOMENT` bulk-data
  export bridge to **sbeam**. Locked decisions: concept-mode generalization,
  Schrenk analytical aero, sbeam export bridge, vertical-slice-first build order.
  Steps C0–C8 are tracked in `docs/30_future/00_backlog.md`; the full narrative,
  schema additions and per-step detail are in
  `docs/30_future/01_concept_loads_plan.md`. Reframed the project scope in
  `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` accordingly (FAR23 replication core *being grown
  into* a concept loads tool). The FAR23 replication core stays oracle-locked
  (Appendix A/B ±0.1%) and concept mode reduces exactly to it on GA inputs.
  *(Planning docs only — no analytical code changed yet.)*
- **MTOW-vs-OEW reference plot on the Weight Estimate page** — the page now plots
  the estimated max take-off and empty weights against a bundled reference fleet
  (Cessna 150/172/182/206/210, Van's RV-7/8/10/14, Bonanza A36, PA-46, King Air
  200, ATR 42-500, Dash 8-100) as a log-log Plotly scatter, with the analysis
  airplane highlighted. Reference figures live in `app/data/reference_aircraft.csv`
  (nominal published specs, UI reference only — never used in a FAR computation) and
  are guarded by `tests/test_reference_aircraft.py`. Adds `plotly>=5.0` as a runtime
  dependency.
- **Seed the weight data base from the estimate** — new pure-calc helper
  `weight_estimate.estimate_to_mass_items(inp)` expands WTESTIMA's structure,
  powerplant and systems component weights (plus options/miscellaneous) into
  empty-weight `MassItem` rows, skipping the group totals and the propeller line
  already inside "Engine installed". `app/pages/01_Weight_Estimate.py` gains a
  "Seed Weight, CG & Inertia from this estimate" button that writes those rows
  into `Project.weight.items`, so the Weight, CG & Inertia page opens pre-filled
  (stations/inertias left at zero for the user). Covered by
  `tests/test_weight_estimate.py::test_seed_mass_items_from_estimate`.
- **MACHLIM Mach-limit lines** — `mach_limit` (MACHLIM) ported against Appendix A
  p160: never-exceed and flutter-clearance Mach (`MNE = 0.9·MD`, `MFC = 1.2·MD`)
  and the per-altitude Mach-limited equivalent airspeeds `V(M) = M·a·√σ` from the
  shoulder altitude to the max operating altitude. Reproduces MNE 0.3627, MFC
  0.4836 and V(MC) 170.16→150.77 (12000→18000 ft). New `MachLimitInput` on
  `Project.speeds.mach_limit`, reusing `constants.standard_atmosphere`;
  `app/pages/06_Mach_Limit.py` (with a V-vs-altitude chart), inputs in the example,
  and `tests/test_mach_limit.py`. **Completes Phase 2.**
- **STRSPEED structural design speeds** — `structural_speeds` (STRSPEED) ported
  against the Appendix A V-n table: limit maneuver load factors (FAR 23.337,
  `n = 2.1 + 24000/(W+10000)` capped by category, negative −0.4n/−0.5n) and design
  airspeeds VA/VC/VD/VF (FAR 23.335) with their minimums, plus cruise/dive Mach at
  the shoulder altitude. Reproduces VA 121.3, VC 170, VD 212.5, VF 105.5, n
  +3.8/−1.52, MC 0.323/MD 0.403 @ 12000 ft. New `StructuralSpeedsInput` /
  `Project.speeds` slice, a shared `constants.standard_atmosphere` helper (also for
  MACHLIM) plus `cruise_speed_coefficient`/`dive_ratio_coefficient`, wing area read
  from the WINGGEOM geometry slice (2·13257/144 = 184.1 ft²),
  `app/pages/05_Structural_Speeds.py`, speeds slice in the example, and
  `tests/test_structural_speeds.py`. VD uses the 1.25·VC floor (the worked
  example's governing bound); K_d·VC is reported as the recommended gust value.
- **WTENV weight/CG envelope** — `weight_envelope` (WTENV) ported against the
  Chapter 3 worked example: structural CG-limit stations (`X = XLEMAC + pct·MAC`,
  reading wing XLEMAC/MAC from the geometry slice via WINGGEOM), minimum/maximum
  loadings, the forward discretionary-loading envelope, and the ballast to reach
  each structural limit (`WB = WL−WA`, moment-balance station). Reproduces the
  manual's stations (85.1/77.49/72.64), min flight 2063@73.09, max load 3322@84.56
  and ballast weights 78/418/158. New `WeightEnvelopeInput` under `Project.weight`,
  `app/pages/04_Weight_Envelope.py`, envelope inputs in the example, and
  `tests/test_weight_envelope.py`. The aft-gross ballast station is the exact
  moment balance (~108.5 in); the manual's hand calc rounded it to 103.7 (limit
  station 85.0 vs the precise 85.107) — documented in the module.
- **Phase 2 geometry** — `wing_geometry` (WINGGEOM) ported against Appendix A
  p141: spanwise strip-sum of area, MAC, YLE(MAC), XLEMAC, aspect ratio and span
  per aerodynamic surface (the wing reproduces MAC 69.246 / XLEMAC 63.641 / AR
  6.095 within ±0.1% at the manual's 20-element count). New `Project.geometry`
  slice (`GeometryInput` → `SurfaceInput` with LE/TE point polylines, `symmetric`,
  `elements`), `geometry_from_dict`/`geometry_to_dict`, wing+aileron surfaces in
  the example, `app/pages/03_Wing_Geometry.py`, and `tests/test_wing_geometry.py`.
  `units.py` gained area (in²→m²) and airspeed (knot→m/s) SI output. Wing-mounted
  engine spanwise stations are derived from `engine_layout`.
- **First-class multi-engine layout** — the `Project` engine slice is now a list
  (`engines: List[EngineInput]`) plus an `EngineLayout` enum constrained to the
  modelled layouts (`SINGLE_NOSE` = 1 nose, `TWIN_WING` = 2 wing, `QUAD_WING` =
  4 wing, symmetric). `Project.__post_init__` validates the engine count against
  the layout; a read-only `Project.engine` property returns the first engine so
  single-engine call sites are unchanged. `io.py` reads either the new
  `"engines"`/`"engine_layout"` JSON or the legacy single `"engine"` key, and the
  engine module's `run(project)` loops over every engine (single-engine output is
  byte-identical; multi-engine prefixes each condition with the engine
  designation). Resolves PROJECT_GUIDE open decision #2 ("model the field now").
  Full one-engine-out *loads* still land at `ONENGOUT`.
- **Phase 1 mass properties** — two modules ported against Appendix A:
  `weight_estimate` (WTESTIMA, statistical weight estimate; reproduces the p133
  figures exactly) and `weight_onecg` (WTONECG, one-loading weight/CG/inertia;
  matches the p136 figures within ±0.1%). New `Project.weight` slice
  (`WeightInput` = mission `estimation` + itemized `items` mass list), with
  `EngineWeightType`/`MassItemKind` enums and the installed-engine-weight
  correlation centralised in `constants.py`. New Streamlit pages
  `01_Weight_Estimate.py` and `02_Weight_CG_Inertia.py`, example weight slice in
  `examples/ga6_normal.project.json`, and `tests/test_weight_estimate.py` /
  `tests/test_weight_onecg.py`. The pages offer an SI **output** toggle (weight →
  kg, inertia → kg·m², CG → mm). `WTENV` re-scoped to Phase 2 (needs `WINGGEOM`'s
  `XLEMAC`/`MAC`).
- `report.module_text_report` — module-agnostic text output, used by the
  generalised `cli.py` stdout path so non-engine modules render correctly.
- **Packaging & tooling** — `pyproject.toml` (editable install via
  `pip install -e '.[dev]'`; `ruff` and `pytest`/coverage config), `cspell.json`
  domain wordlist, and a GitHub Actions CI workflow running `ruff` + `pytest` on
  Python 3.9 / 3.11 / 3.12.
- **Documentation structure** — `docs/` reorganised by type
  (`10_standard` / `20_theory` / `30_future` / `40_history`) with an index
  (`docs/00_INDEX.md`). Added `docs/20_theory/00_theory_sources.md`,
  `docs/30_future/00_backlog.md`, and `docs/40_history/00_completed_development.md`.
- **Process guides** — `docs/10_standard/CODE_REVIEW_PROCESS.md` and
  `RELEASE_PROCESS.md`, specialised for the module-porting workflow.
- **`LICENSE`** (MIT) backing the `pyproject.toml` license declaration, plus
  README License and Disclaimer sections (results are not certified for design).
- **`docs/10_standard/00_program_overview.md`** — consolidated program code
  standard & developer guide (coding standards, an error-handling contract,
  units, entry points, testing/coverage), with `docs/00_INDEX.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
  pointing to it as the authoritative standard.
- **CI coverage floor** — the pytest step now runs with `--cov-fail-under=80` so
  coverage cannot silently regress (a ratchet, to be raised toward 85%).

### Changed

- **Documentation critical review & consistency pass.** Brought the docs in line
  with the as-built code (Phases 0–2 + Phase-C C0–C6; 13 of 22 suite programs +
  `configuration`/`body_loads`; `SCHEMA_VERSION` 11). Rewrote
  `docs/30_future/00_backlog.md` as a dependency-ordered step-by-step plan
  (Steps C7–C11 + deferred refinements + open decisions + a release/versioning
  item). Corrected stale status in `docs/10_standard/00_program_overview.md`
  (structure tree + "Phase 0 complete"), `README.md` ("7 of 22" → 13 of 22; layout
  tree), `CLAUDE.md` (`Project` "currently just engine"; the contradictory
  `sys.path`-shim line), `PROJECT_GUIDE.md` ("exactly one is ported", §2 inventory
  status, §7 roadmap, examples list), `PROGRAM_SPEC.md` (status-summary Phase 0
  row), and `docs/00_INDEX.md`. Removed the superseded `Phase1_2_review.md`
  GUI-review notes (its one live item — Home Engineer/Date fields — moved to the
  backlog). No analytical code changed.
- **SI mass vs Imperial force units.** `LoadValue` gained an optional `quantity`
  hint so the SI converter can tell a pounds-*mass* weight (→ kg) from a
  pounds-*force* load (→ N) — both labelled `lb`. Added `lb-in² → kg·m²` to the
  result converter; weights set `quantity="mass"`. Engine load output is
  unchanged.
- `cli.py` text output is now module-agnostic (was engine-specific), and
  `io.load_cases_csv` falls back to the generic property table for modules that
  emit no structural load cases, so the mass-properties modules export usable CSV.
- `farloads` and `cli` are now an editable install, so they import from any cwd;
  removed the `sys.path` shims from `app/Home.py` and `app/pages/19_Engine_Mount.py`.
- Renamed the ambiguous local helper `l` to `ln` in `farloads/units.py` (lint).
- Fixed stale `calc.py` references (the module is `farloads/modules/engine.py`) in
  `farloads/models.py` and `farloads/report.py` comments/docstrings.
- `CLAUDE.md` mandate strengthened: consult the `reference/` PDFs when generating
  analysis code, keep `docs/` in sync with every code change, and follow the
  backlog → history → changelog move-on-completion rule.
- `docs/PROGRAM_SPEC.md` and `docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md` moved to `docs/10_standard/`;
  cross-references in `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated.
