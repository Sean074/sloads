# `baron_58.project.json` — data sources register

The oracle GUI user guide's worked twin (design note 34, UG-9): a Beechcraft
**Baron 58**, normal category, two Continental **IO-550-C** — the
configuration of Model 58 serials **TH-1396 through TH-2124** (plus TH-1389).

**Construction rule (UG-9).** Every certified value below is cited to the
document it was read in. Everything not published — mass breakdown, planform
chords, tail areas, nacelle butt line, aero coefficients — is **estimated**,
marked **[E]**, and never presented as the airplane's certified value. The
example exists to teach the tool; where an estimate is load-bearing the guide
says so. Stored values are Imperial (the project file's canonical channel);
the guide enters and reads this example in **SI** (UG-12).

## Estimated values [E] and their anchors

- **Wing planform**: root 84 in / tip 42 in (taper 0.5). Anchored: the
  straight quarter-chord this gives sits at sta 83.0 ≈ the front-spar jack
  pads at 83.1 [A], and the trapezoid area (198.6 ft²) is within 0.3 % of the
  published 199.2 ft² [B]. MAC 65.3 in at buttline 101, x-LEMAC 66.7 — the
  WTENV %-MAC limits in the file are the [A] station limits through this MAC.
- **Tail areas**: h-tail 53 ft² on the published 191-in span; v-tail 24.3 ft²,
  66-in span. Statistical GA-twin proportions; tail stations placed against
  the published 358-in length [B].
- **Nacelle butt line ±66 in**: outboard of the 57.5-in gear half-track [B]
  (the mains retract into the nacelles), giving the 77-in prop [A] ~28 in of
  fuselage clearance.
- **Chosen Vd 248 kt**: from Vne = 0.9 Vd with the published Vne 223 [A]. No
  design dive speed is published.
- **CLmax clean 1.15 / flaps 1.53**: derived from typical published stall
  speeds (~84 kt clean, ~73 kt landing) at MTOW through the constructed wing
  loading — the module's clean 1-g stall reproduces ~84 KEAS.
- **Mass breakdown**: statistical component split summing to the published
  4,010 lb empty [B] at sta 78.3; discretionary rows (occupants, baggage,
  fuel) sit at the [A] arms. The flight loading of 120 US gal fuel + 4
  occupants closes at exactly 5,500 lb inside the [A] envelope — the `aft
  gross` case, whose waterline 95.88 is that loading's own (D-26a; no source
  states a flight waterline, and the 100.0 it carried until #300 matched no
  loading of this database) — and each
  roled ground case **states its loading** (D-25 `loading` records): aft max
  landing 5,400 lb at sta 85.7, fwd max landing 5,400 lb at sta 79.1, fwd
  light 4,440 lb at sta 78.1 — all inside the [A] limits. Inertias are
  order-of-magnitude estimates.
- **Gear geometry**: axle stations/waterlines, 8-in oleo stroke, 20-in tire —
  statistical; tread is the published 115 in [B], oleo strut type per the
  Baron's air-oil gear.
- **Aero coefficients** (section slope 0.107/deg, cm −0.008, polar, twist,
  elevator/rudder throws and hinge splits, tab data): handbook-typical values
  for the 230-series sections and a GA twin; none are published data.

## Cross-checks the file passes

- Loads every page of the oracle GUI; all 14 run without error (gate G-UG-4,
  `tests/test_guide.py`), including ONENGOUT with the off-centreline failed
  engine.
- No `validation.consistency_warnings` on load: loading CG inside the WTENV
  envelope, the G-4/G-14 weight chain, the note-29 wing-mass tie
  (items tagged `wing` = 2 × (WINGINER panel + concentrated)) all close.
- The oracle **reduction reproduces it exactly** (`tests/test_oracle_inputs.py`
  `EXACT`): every load-bearing field is an original-suite input — engine and
  propeller weight/CG are entered directly on the ENGLOADS records (duplicated
  into the weight database rows at the same values, the cessna_210 pattern).
