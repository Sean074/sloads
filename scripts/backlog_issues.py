"""The backlog ↔ GitHub Issues bridge (design note 28 MD-5).

Issues are the system of record for open work; ``docs/30_future/00_backlog.md``
keeps the plan (mission, definition of done, the priority table with bands).
This script does the one-off migration and the standing both-ways check:

    plan     parse the backlog into the issue set and print it (no gh, no writes)
    create   open the issues with ``gh`` (labels created idempotently), record
             ``title -> #N`` in .github/backlog_issue_map.json
    rewrite  add ``(#N)`` to every priority-table row and replace each detail
             section / defect bullet with a one-line pointer to its issue
    check    every priority-table row names an open issue, every open issue
             labelled ``band:*`` appears in the table, and every row's issue sits
             on the milestone its **band header** names — never on one already
             cut in CHANGELOG.md (needs gh; exit 1 on drift)
    render   regenerate the priority table's item rows from the issues: a row
             whose issue is CLOSED is dropped, an OPEN issue's row is re-emitted
             from its body (the ``**Item.** / **What ships.** / **Tag.** /
             **Tier / effort.** / **Depends on.**`` block ``create`` wrote), so
             the table is a *view* of the issues and no closing PR edits it
             (``DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md`` §4). Band header rows, the cut-line row
             and everything outside the table are kept byte-for-byte. Under the
             solo profile (§0) the file is the record and this is not run.

Pure functions (``parse_backlog``, ``issue_set``, ``rewrite_backlog``,
``render_backlog``, ``row_from_issue``) work on strings so
``tests/test_backlog_issues.py`` runs them on the live file without ``gh``;
only ``create``, ``check`` and ``render`` shell out. Owner-run; never from CI.
