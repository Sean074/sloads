"""Keep `.github/branch-protection.json` in step with the live protection on `main`.

**Why this exists.** A documented git/CI setting and the live one drifted apart
twice on 2026-08-25 and nothing compared them: `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §4,
`DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md` §0/§2 and `WORKFLOW_COMMANDS.txt` all asserted "linear
history off, merge commits allowed" while `main` enforces linear history and
refused the 0.7.2 milestone PR ("This branch must not contain merge commits");
separately, §2 listed six required checks, three of which `ci.yml` never
produces on a pull request. Backlog row 6 / issue #46, review finding CR-D-4.

**The two hops.** CI cannot read GitHub — the test job has no `gh` auth — so the
comparison is split:

1. **snapshot -> docs**, on every test run, no network:
   `tests/test_ci_conformance.py` asserts the prose in the process docs against
   this file, and asserts every required check in it is one `ci.yml` actually
   reports on a pull request.
2. **live -> snapshot**, on demand, needs `gh`: this script. Run
   ``--check`` (it exits 1 on any difference) or ``--write`` to refresh.

Run ``--check`` when you change a protection setting, and at the release cut
(`RELEASE_PROCESS.md` §4). It is deliberately *not* wired into CI: a gate that
needs a credential CI does not have is a gate that silently skips, which is the
defect class this whole row is about.
